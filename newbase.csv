33364,"HOLLAND, Pa. -- The Tea Party movement ignited a year ago, fueled by anti-establishment anger. Now, Tea Party activists are trying to take over the establishment, ground up. Across the country, they are signing up to be Republican precinct leaders, a position so low-level that it often remains vacant, but which comes with the ability to vote for the party executives who endorse candidates, approve platforms and decide where the party spends money. TD A new group called the National Precinct Alliance says it has a coordinator in nearly every state to recruit Tea Party activists to fill the positions and has already swelled the number of like-minded members in Republican Party committees in Arizona and Nevada. Its mantra is this: take the precinct, take the state, take the party -- and force it to nominate conservatives rather than people they see as liberals in Republican clothing. Here, in a perennial battleground district outside Philadelphia, Tea Party activists are trying to strip the local committee of its influence in choosing the Republican nominee to run against Representative Patrick J. Murphy, a Democrat who won the seat in 2006 by about 1,500 votes. After the local party said it would stick to its custom of endorsing a candidate rather than holding an open primary, Tea Party groups decided to hold their own candidate forum where people could cast a ballot. If the party does not yield, the groups say they will host a debate, too. ''We kind of changed the rules,'' said Anastasia Przybylski, one of the organizers. The Tea Party movement, named the original tax revolt in 1773, might be better described as a diverse, rambunctious and Internet-connected network of groups, powered by grass-roots anxiety about the economy, bailouts and increasing government involvement in health care. At one extreme are militia members who have shown up at meetings wearing guns and suggesting that institutions like the Federal Reserve be eliminated. At the other are those like Ms. Przybylski, who describes herself as ''just a stay-at-home mom'' who became agitated about the federal stimulus package. And if the Democrats are big-government socialists, the Republicans, in the Tea Party mind, are enablers. In some recent polls, a hypothetical Tea Party wins more support than Democrats or Republicans, and the most anti-establishment Tea Party activists push to fight as a third party. But as the movement looks toward the midterm elections in November, a growing number of activists argue that the best way to translate anger into influence is to infiltrate the Republican establishment (Democrats being, for the average Tea Partier, beyond redemption). ''If you want to have revenge against the Republican Party for using you for so many years, the best way is to turn around and use the Republican Party to your advantage,'' said Eric Odom, a Tea Party activist in Chicago who recently started a political action committee, and on his blog urged Tea Partiers to stop complaining about the Republican Party and ''move in and take it over.'' Republican leaders have been trying to harness the Tea Party energy -- Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, recently called the Tea Parties ''a revelatory moment.'' ''It puts in stark relief where the American people are, how they feel and what they feel,'' Mr. Steele said. ''It's important for our party to appreciate and understand that so we can move toward it, and embrace it.'' Not all Republicans agree. Some say the party needs to broaden its reach, not cater to the fringe. The defining experience for many Tea Party groups was the special election in the 23rd Congressional District of New York in November, where party leaders chose a candidate whom conservatives viewed as a Republican in name only -- she supported same-sex marriage, abortion rights and the federal stimulus package. After activists flooded the district to support a conservative third-party candidate, the Republican dropped out and endorsed the Democrat, who won. Conservatives took the Republican retreat as a victory, but also saw the power of the party structure in deciding who the candidates will be. The rallying cry for more local involvement has been ''No more NY-23's.'' ''We don't want to see what happened in New York happen here,'' Ms. Przybylski said. The forum here drew nine candidates and a standing-room crowd in an auditorium built for 1,200. The questions organizers had drawn up for the candidates hinted at the issues important to so called Teapublicans. Will you pledge to vote against tax increases, even hidden taxes like those in health care reform? Should corporate executives who encourage illegal immigrants to stay because it is good for business be hauled off to jail? Do you believe manmade pollution is a significant contributor to global warming? (''I don't necessarily think there's been global warming,'' one candidate objected.) Each was asked to define the 10th Amendment, and to cite examples of where it ''might have been violated.'' ''It's my favorite amendment in the Constitution,'' exclaimed one candidate, Ira Hoffman. ''I can't believe it!'' The amendment declares that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people, and Tea Party activists hold that Congress has overstepped its bounds, particularly by legislating health care. So candidates were asked whether they would support efforts to nullify the health care bill? Finally, the moderator asked them if 2010 would be ''the year of the Tea Party.'' The candidates, and many in the audience, said it would, but only if the Tea Party advocates worked the system. ''I think we can do greater things working in a system that's established than we ever can being a bunch of anarchists,'' said Jennifer Turner Stefano, a vice president of a local Tea Party group who is contesting her local Republican committeeperson. Ms. Stefano, a stay-at-home mother and former television reporter, will have to get 10 signatures and put her name on the ballot to run. But the National Precinct Alliance estimates that about 60 percent of the roughly 150,000 local Republican committee seats are vacant and can be filled by essentially showing up. ''Even if you've got a slight majority, you just need maybe 26 states, then you can have your say in how the party goes,'' said Philip Glass, a former commercial mortgage banker in Cincinnati who is the national director of the precinct alliance. The precinct strategy, like the Tea Party movement itself, has spread via the Internet, on sites like Resistnet.com. A National Tea Party Convention in Nashville next month will feature seminars on how to take over starting at the precinct level. Advocates hold up the example of Las Vegas, where a group of about 30 people who had become friendly at Tea Party events last spring met to discuss how they could turn their crowds into political influence. One mentioned that there were about 500 open precinct committee positions in the local Republican Party. They recruited other activists and flooded the committee -- the Republican Party says it now has 780 committee people, up from about 300. In July, they approved a new executive committee, and Tony Warren, one of the organizers and a new precinct committeeman himself, said six out of seven executives are ''constitutional conservatives,'' in keeping with Tea Party ideology. With the bulk of Nevada's population in the Las Vegas area, the local committee was able to elect a conservative slate to the state party in December, including a state chairman who has said he wants to make the party ''safe'' for conservatives. As recently as last spring, Mr. Warren said, ''we didn't even know how the darn party worked.'' PHOTOS: The audience, top, at a forum held by Tea Party groups in Holland, Pa.

33365,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 -- President Bush delivered two competing messages to Americans today as he encouraged them to go to ballgames and get on airplanes but at the same time declared that the country was at risk.   ''Our nation is still in danger,'' Mr. Bush said at a White House reception as he announced a fourth case of anthrax, this one in New York City. ''But the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''  TD  Seconds later, Mr. Bush exhorted Americans to go about their lives.   ''We cannot let the terrorists lock our country down,'' he said. ''We can't let terrorists, a few evildoers, hold us hostage.'' Americans, he said, need to fight terrorism ''by going to work, going to ballgames, getting on airplanes, singing with joy and strength.''   The dueling messages of reassurance and warning echoed the themes of the president's prime-time news conference on Thursday night and presented a growing challenge, Republicans say, for Mr. Bush not to confuse or frighten Americans. But the consensus among the professionals who help fashion presidential images is that Mr. Bush is on track, for now. His message, they say, is simple: Go out, but be careful. America has changed.   ''I think that's the reality, and I think we're going to be bounced back and forth and up and down for a long time to come,'' said Michael K. Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image consultant who has advised the current White House. ''I think he's done a pretty good job of trying to balance that role of counselor or calmer along with his role as commander in chief.''   Mr. Deaver added: ''Everything I've seen, just in my own experience, tells me that people are hanging on to the government for the first time in a long time. This is when Washington is important. I hope he understands that we need constant reassurance. It's topic A, and it really is based on fear. I think he senses that, and so he is out there much more than normal.''   So far Mr. Bush has not crystallized his message of reassurance and warning into a succinct sound bite, but has veered back and forth, depending on the day or event. Two weeks ago in Chicago, when he announced new security measures at the nation's airports, Mr. Bush seemed to become the national travel director, urging Americans to fly again.   But in announcing the new case of anthrax today with jarring words in the middle of an East Room celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month that included the singer Gloria Estefan,  Mr. Bush was once again the bearer of alarming news.   The case of anthrax, he said, ''has got to cause concern for our nation.'' Mr. Bush then reported that the victim was ''doing well'' and that she ''obviously didn't ingest enough to cause death, thank God.'' He also said that ''I want everybody in the country to know we're responding rapidly'' and added that ''the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster, said that so far Americans seemed to understand the simultaneous warnings of danger and cheerful proddings to live again. ''I think people recognize that both of these things are true,'' he said. ''We haven't had foreigners killing Americans here since I guess the War of 1812, and we've always had this notion that these two big oceans have kept us protected. Over the longer term we are now going to have to live with this risk, and at the same time not let it change us.''   Mr. Teeter cited bombings in London and terrorism in other countries in Europe as a model, however distressing, for how Americans can adjust to an undercurrent of fear in their lives.   ''It's clear that democracies and relatively open societies can learn to live with it,'' Mr. Teeter said. ''But I think it will be an adjustment and change for this country.''   Mr. Bush and the White House have sought to harness some of that fear by asking each child in America to donate a dollar to Afghan children. Today Mr. Bush said the inspiration for his campaign came from the March of Dimes, which began nearly 64 years ago based on another fear, polio. Over four months in 1938, he said, Americans sent 2.6 million dimes to the White House of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who himself had the disease.   ''Late in life, Eleanor Roosevelt asked what her husband had learned from the experience of polio,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech today to a March of Dimes conference at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ''She said that Franklin had gained strength and courage he had not before.''   Noting that a dollar today is roughly equivalent to a dime in the late 1930's, Mr. Bush, at that moment the reassurer, concluded: ''We all need to have a bit of Franklin Roosevelt in us today.''

33366,"AS oil and gasoline prices rise, political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve is building, including among some in Congress. The global oil market is fundamentally strained and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems. Yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses. Instead it should be preserved to address an emergency disruption in supply. TD While no one can confidently predict the global oil market, arguments that prices will remain high throughout the year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative. Global supplies are tight, and the hope for an improving global economy will only increase demand. Historically, Saudi Arabia has maintained a cushion of spare production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply. This spare capacity has played a critical role in calming the market when instability threatens oil-producing nations. That spare capacity is now likely to be only 3 percent, which will make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to increase production on short notice. The past year of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has not resulted in any major supply disruptions, but roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in Sudan, Yemen and Syria, and the growing impact of United States and European sanctions on Iranian production. If successful, President Obama's recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on Iran and strain global oil markets further. Indeed, increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is good news in the effort to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capability. Iran's total production is now about 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 2 million barrels per day are exported. The United States Energy Information Administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this summer could cut demand for Iranian oil exports in half. This combination of circumstances, however, does not yet constitute a severe supply disruption. Using the reserve now would be premature, reduce our national security options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets. Since its inception in 1975, the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances. There have been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions, including test sales, exchanges to address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise $220 million to balance the federal budget. The oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions -- during the first Iraq war, after Hurricane Katrina, and last year, when President Obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil during that country's civil war. In each instance, the releases were coordinated internationally, through the International Energy Agency, with some oil offered by the European Union, the United States and other non-OPEC nations. Each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances. While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances, the president and Congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of $100-a-barrel oil and $4-a-gallon gasoline. Despite the traditional election-year rancor, there is actually considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done. Increasing domestic oil production is extremely important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit. The United States is the third largest oil producer in the world and United States production must continue to play a critical role in meeting global demand. That production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by 2020. If this increase is achieved, the American contribution to the global market will push down global prices and could enable some increase in global spare capacity. The Obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production. However, no amount of production can insulate the United States from the global market and global price spikes. The ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use compared to the size of our economy. In 1975, our economy used 1.2 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of gross domestic product (2005 dollars); in 2010, we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of G.D.P. This reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel economy. A diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of Congress. While it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades, there is considerable support in both parties for efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels, electric and natural gas vehicles. All of these actions will continue to increase the oil-efficiency and resiliency of the United States economy. For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets. RF",[],hr
33367,"Caucusgoers, uniquely, will declare their loyalty before their friends and neighbors. And they are taking their responsibility very seriously. CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- It is a public display of civic duty unique in American politics: Iowans on Monday night will stand in front of their neighbors and express their preference for a candidate for president. No curtains covering a voting machine. No private paper ballots. Just a declaration of loyalty before fellow Democrats. TD The Iowa caucuses are at once both quaint and globally significant, with a singular power to elevate, or deflate, candidacies. But for all of their idiosyncrasies, perhaps their most distinctive element is the sheer transparency they provide to the selection process. At a time of such political polarization, underpinned by anxiety among Iowa Democrats that they will elevate a nominee unable to defeat President Trump, the public nature of the caucuses has amplified the stakes. In interviews with scores of Iowans over the last three months, many expressed ambivalence about making a choice, desperately trying to assess what kind of candidate others might want to elect. Many appeared wary of picking sides, and risking fragmentation, at the expense of presenting a united front; they vowed to support the eventual nominee no matter what. Some caucusgoers said, tellingly, that they were eager to knock doors for candidates they supported but preferred to do so in nearby towns or counties lest they alienate their neighbors. ''The idea is that the caucuses are this very romantic Jeffersonian thing, with neighbors gathering in small groups to discuss ideas and candidates, and help choose leadership that will organize volunteers and lead us to electoral victory,'' said Nathan Thompson, the Democratic chairman in Winneshiek County. ''Well, in reality, it can be a very frustrating and divisive thing for all of these volunteers and attendees.'' It is another complicating factor in a race full of them. Even elected officials are trying to divine the best approach. Rob Sand, the state auditor and a rising star in the Democratic Party, said he planned to caucus for ''uncommitted,'' a category for those who do not want to align themselves with a candidate. Or he may not caucus at all. ''Ultimately, many of us will have a nominee who was not our first choice -- we are going to have to put that aside and do our duty to help that nominee win,'' Mr. Sand said. ''So, I'm planning to set aside my own ability to make a choice to be a voice for unity.'' As the caucuses loom, Iowa Democrats are preparing to make what may be their most significant decision ever, one that could set the party on a path to ousting Mr. Trump from the White House or divide it further. And rarely has the outcome of the caucuses been so difficult to predict or so highly anticipated. ''Anything can happen here,'' said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. ''There's growing clarity -- but there's not a lot of clarity.'' Adding to the sense of uncertainty, both the progressive and moderate wings of the party have taken turns asserting their dominance. All four of the leading candidates -- Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., -- have led polls here in recent months. Another challenger, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has edged closer but not yet close enough. Most recently, Mr. Sanders has appeared to open up a lead in Iowa, consolidating liberal backing as more moderate candidates in the race continue to split their support. A nascent attempt by moderate Democrats at thwarting his rise before it is too late has shown signs of backfiring. Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $1 million off a negative ad last week that targeted him by name. Iowa is already on tenterhooks. For months, it has defended itself against criticism that it is too white, its caucuses too exclusionary, to have the privilege of being the first state in the nominating process. Candidates have questioned the state's leadoff position in the calendar. Across the state, Iowans are wary that the absence of a clean victory could muddle the choice for Democrats in other states and undermine Iowa's claim to serving as a springboard to the nomination. ''I do think the Iowa caucuses might come to an end, especially if the results are indecisive,'' said John Grennan, the Democratic chairman in Poweshiek County. ''2016 was very messy. 2020 could be, too.'' Yet the race's prevailing uncertainty has not stopped strategists, campaign aides and caucusgoers from prognosticating that has grown more frenetic as the Iowa contest approaches. It is a parlor game that has been rendered even more difficult by a complex new set of caucus rules. For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will report, on a rolling basis, three numbers on caucus night -- a delegate count and the amount of support on both the first and second rounds, known as alignments -- leaving open the possibility that more than one candidate could claim victory. What if Mr. Sanders receives the most support on the first alignment but another candidate wins on the delegate count? What if the top candidates are clustered together, separated by only a few percentage points? Such inconclusive results would make it difficult for any candidate to ride unrivaled momentum into New Hampshire one week later. And should voters remain as undecided in New Hampshire as in Iowa, Democrats could be staring at an extended primary fight that could leave everyone bruised. For Democrats hoping for a clearer picture after Monday's caucuses, it could lead to more hand-wringing and division. Candidates have already begun attacking their rivals in a bid for dominance. Some campaigns have provided clues as to how they will assess the results on caucus night. Senior advisers to Mr. Sanders have indicated the Sanders campaign will declare victory if Mr. Sanders gets the most support on the first alignment. Aides to Mr. Buttigieg, on the other hand, are focusing on the delegate count. The Iowa Democratic Party and other party officials have encouraged the news media to report the delegate count, as has traditionally been done. With so many undecided caucusgoers, the results could come down to how well organized campaigns are, particularly at the precinct level, where the final persuading will take place. Some campaigns have put in place precinct teams to persuade and wrangle caucusgoers before and after the first alignment. Precinct captains will be in touch constantly with their campaign headquarters for directives on their strategy inside the room. Among caucusgoers, the persistent discussion of statewide political angst has only produced more angst. The degree of uncertainty, lingering even at this final stage of the precaucus season, has confounded some Democratic officials. ''Most people are undecided, and not only are they undecided but they're considering staying undecided on caucus night,'' said Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats. ''Considering the sheer number of candidates and length of the campaign season, I didn't think we would be in this position so close.'' Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Reid Epstein from Coralville, Iowa.

33369,"CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 29 -- Opponents of President Hugo Chavez stepped up preparations today for a general strike next week, heading toward another bruising confrontation with the government.   An anti-Chavez business leader, Carlos Fernandez, said the strike would start early Monday. The other main organizer, Carlos Ortega, a union leader, said, ''The situation is unsustainable.''  TD  As political tensions mounted before the strike, debate raged over a decision by the nation's electoral authorities to call a referendum for Feb. 2 on Mr. Chavez's presidency. The government, backed by a Supreme Court ruling that appeared to contradict the National Election Council decision on Thursday, rejected the referendum as illegal and unconstitutional.   But the electoral body said today that the referendum requested by the opposition was valid and should go ahead.   Mr. Chavez, the former paratrooper who was elected in 1998 and survived a brief coup in April, says the country's Constitution only allows for a binding referendum on his presidency in August, halfway through the term.   The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, called today for restraint and a peaceful solution to the crisis, joining a chorus of concern over Venezuela's conflict.  NS",[],hr
33370,"WASHINGTON -- Leading Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday reacted skeptically to the idea of overhauling surveillance laws to make it easier to wiretap people who communicate online rather than by telephone, a major priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawmakers expressed their concerns at a House hearing devoted to a problem that law enforcement officials call ''going dark'' -- investigators' inability to carry out court-approved wiretap orders when the people who are the targets communicate using services that lack a surveillance capability. TD The F.B.I. has been quietly laying the groundwork for years for a push to require Internet-based communications services -- like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerry and Skype -- to design their systems with a built-in way to comply with wiretap orders. On Thursday, the bureau made its first full airing of the ''going dark'' problem. ''Due to the revolutionary expansion of communications technology in recent years, the government finds that it is rapidly losing ground in its ability to execute court orders with respect to Internet-based communications,'' said the F.B.I.'s general counsel, Valerie Caproni. A 1994 law requires phone companies to build their networks with the capability of immediately starting to intercept a user's communications when the company is presented with a wiretap order. But that law does not cover Internet-based communication providers. As a result, while they, too, are subject to court wiretap orders, they are often unable to comply, for technical reasons, when presented with one. Ms. Caproni stopped short of making any specific legislative proposal, saying that the Obama administration was still debating the issue internally. Last fall, The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials were developing a bill that would impose new regulations on Internet communications companies and phone and broadband carriers, making them easier to wiretap. ''We don't have a specific request yet,'' Ms. Caproni said. ''The administration does not yet have a proposal. It is something that is actively being discussed within the administration, and I am optimistic that we will have a proposal in the near future.'' Still, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, was one of several lawmakers who said he was likely to greet such a proposal with skepticism. Forcing Internet communications services to build in ''back doors'' for law enforcement surveillance, he said, would hamper innovation and create vulnerabilities for hackers and foreign governments to exploit. ''Requiring back doors in all communications systems by law runs counter to how the Internet works and may make it impossible for some companies to offer their services,'' Mr. Conyers said. Several lawmakers of both parties raised concerns about how such a mandate would affect the competitiveness of Internet companies that operate in the United States. Still, several Republicans suggested sympathy with law enforcement officials' fear that changing technology could hamper their ability to investigate criminals and terrorists. Ms. Caproni emphasized that the F.B.I. was not seeking new surveillance powers, but rather a way to keep its existing powers from eroding. She also said the F.B.I. was not seeking a decryption key that would allow the government to directly intercept and unscramble secure communications. Rather, she said, the bureau hoped to require communication service providers to deploy, within their own systems, a wiretapping capability. The provider would have to be able to isolate, intercept and deliver to the government a particular user's communications in response to a wiretap order. Susan Landau, a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study fellow and former Sun Microsystems engineer, argued against building interception systems within a service, citing high-profile cases in which hackers exploited such mechanisms in Greece and Italy to illegally spy on politicians and other prominent people. Ms. Caproni spoke with caution about several aspects of the F.B.I.'s broad goals that have attracted controversy. For example, law enforcement officials have said in the past that all companies that facilitate communications should be able to provide a plain-text version of messages in response to a wiretap order. Such a mandate could require major changes for companies like Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry Enterprise Server system relays encrypted messages that the company says it cannot unscramble. Last year, Research in Motion came into conflict with several governments, including in India and the United Arab Emirates, over their inability to conduct surveillance of messages sent via its encrypted service. Asked about encryption, Ms. Caproni said that if a provider encrypted communications but had the ability to decrypt them, then it should be required to give law enforcement unscrambled versions. And she said that if an individual encrypted his own communications, investigators would have to find some other way to monitor that person. But crucially, she did not directly address whether a service provider should be allowed to encrypt a user's communications in such a way that the provider is unable to unscramble them -- even if a court orders it to do so. The hearing came a day after the release of several hundred pages of internal F.B.I. documents showing that the bureau has been working with great urgency to push to change legislation for years. The documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group. The documents shed new light on how the F.B.I.'s interest in the ''going dark'' problem predates the Obama administration. The bureau commissioned a study from the RAND Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton several years ago, and it conducted surveys of law enforcement officials seeking examples of encountering obstacles to carrying out wiretap orders. One such document redacted a legislative proposal for the ''going dark'' surveillance issue. But beneath it, a related proposal was left uncensored: electronic communications service providers, it said, should be required ''to retain for two years records showing the origination and termination of communications.'' Currently, law enforcement agencies are able to obtain such records only if the provider has chosen to preserve them for its own purposes, like billing.

33371,"WASHINGTON -- George W. Bush has just placed his faith in Saddam Hussein's reliability. If the Iraqi tyrant remains true to form -- again misreading America's once-in-a-decade resolve -- Bush's recently evolved Four Resolution Strategy will bring about his overthrow.   Resolution No. 1 is to come from the U.S. Congress. In mid-October, after a debate between ''Here's the case'' Republicans and ''What was that case again?'' Democrats, Congress will pass a resolution containing the big After: after the U.N. Security Council has made a final effort to insert unfetterable inspectors, and that fails, then the president will be authorized to enforce the terms of the 1991 surrender. But come back again after the election before you bomb anybody.  TD  Resolution No. 2 comes from the U.N.: Submit to intrusive inspections or we may not be able to restrain those bellicose Americans. This is your last chance; this time we mean it.   Resolution No. 3 comes from the Congress, after Saddam has allowed U.N. inspectors in and again begun haggling over where they can go and when. The gist: O.K., Mr. President, you can commence firing, but you'd better have U.N. permission, allies with you and an Iraqi George Washington in the wings.   Resolution No. 4, again from the U.N.: This time, we really really mean it. If you don't cut out the rope-a-dope, we'll pull our frustrated inspectors out next week, lest they be hit by bombers from inpatient member nations. And you'd better not hold our people hostage or there'll be war-crime trials for all officers over the rank of lieutenant.   I deduce this possible drawn-out scenario from a single letter of a single word in President Bush's speech: U.N. resolutions, plural. By mollifying the Baker-Scowcroft-Hagel set, which reflects his father's views, the president has promised to go one U.N. resolution too far.   The other indication of a four-resolution fallback comes from last weekend's reactions of presidential hopefuls. On the Senate Democratic spectrum from hawkish Lieberman-Edwards to dovish Daschle-Kerry, the message has gone forth: We're going to have to vote on this before the election, so let's engage the White House in drawing up a resolution before the election that we can back out of in another resolution afterward.   That's because the original Democratic position -- let's not vote before the election lest the voters' jingoistic views affect our decision -- was untenable. No governmental decision is more important than going to war to prevent an attack, and voters have a right and an obligation to find out where their representatives stand.   In the same way, President Bush had to abandon the notion that all he had to do was ''consult'' with Congressional leaders. He needs Congressional authorization to wage war, just as Congress needs to make its views known by a difficult vote in a timely fashion. Such mutual deference between branches is essential.   Bush softened his position substantially by deferring to the U.N. as well. He covered that softening with tough words clearly implying ''or else,'' and reminding the U.N. of its vulnerability by raising the specter of the feckless League of Nations. His hard words to cloak accommodation fooled no national leaders, but gave Russia and France cover to protect their interests after the U.S. deposes their debtor and customer in Baghdad.   But the quadruple-ultimata strategy adopted by Bush, while it wins praise for uncowboyesque caution from multilateralist media and relieved U.N. officials, depends entirely on the dependability of Saddam.   For this approach to succeed in overthrowing the dangerous dictatorship, the White House is relying on Baghdad to show not merely consistency in recalcitrance, but an insufferable, infuriating intractability in intransigence. Bush is betting that Saddam will (a) reject the U.N resolutions as humiliating or (b) accept the final-final warning and then negotiate endlessly with the inspectors so as to make their mission impossible.   The basis for this gamble is Bush's certainty, based on the logical extrapolation of past and present intelligence reports, that Saddam has evidence of mass-murder weaponry to hide. The Iraqi dictator cannot accede to coercive inspection, enforced by U.N. troops, without blowing up what has cost him more than $100 billion in a decade's oil revenues to build.   That would not be like Saddam. And on that presumed defiance rests Bush's diplomatic strategy.  RF",[],hr
33372,"WASHINGTON, March 26 -- The World Trade Organization ruled today that the steel tariffs imposed by President Bush last year were illegal.   The administration said it would appeal the decision.  TD  While the trade decision was called interim, with the final report expected next month, it is rare for an interim decision to be reversed. If the United States loses next month, European and other nations could impose trade sanctions of comparable value against the United States.   Last spring, Mr. Bush imposed tariffs of nearly 30 percent on most types of steel imported from Europe, Asia and South America, the biggest government action to protect an industry in several decades. While it was praised by the steel industry and trade unionists, the move was criticized by free trade advocates and companies that use steel in manufacturing.   The case against the tariffs was brought by the European Union, which accused the United States of illegally protecting the steel industry. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, called the tariffs ''unjustified, highly protectionist U.S. measures.''   ''I am in no doubt that the U.S. will lose this case, as it has lost all six previous safeguard cases,'' Mr. Lamy said when the initial case was brought against the United States.   But there was no celebratory statement or any comment from the Europeans today. All spokesmen said they would not discuss an interim decision, but foreign officials also said Europe wanted to avoid creating a further division with the United States in a time of war.   Today's ruling, which was not a surprise, was the second major loss for the United States at the W.T.O. in the last year. The trade panel awarded Europe the right to impose $4 billion worth of trade sanctions against the United States for giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations.   When administration officials imposed the steel tariffs they said they were legal under provisions in the world trading rules allowing a response to a surge of steel imports.   The tariffs were meant to help the American steel industry find its footing in the global market. American trade officials said today that the strategy worked.   ''The domestic steel industry has undergone an unprecedented level of consolidation and restructuring over the last year that have made it more competitive,'' said one American trade official, who insisted on not being identified.   Democratic lawmakers criticized the trade decision, citing a United States International Trade Commission study done before the tariffs were imposed that showed imports were seriously injuring important parts of the American steel industry. They said the W.T.O. had exceeded its authority.   ''I support the goal of an international trading system,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ''But we have a growing problem with dispute settlement decisions that are inventing obligations and requirements to which the United States and other countries never agreed. Ultimately, these types of decisions will only undermine confidence in the W.T.O.''   Some Democrats said the administration was partly to blame for failing to adopt an aggressive strategy to end a series of rulings against the United States.   Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, accused the administration of overseeing the loss of 13 of 15 cases brought against the United States since 2001.   ''This decision furthers a trend that jeopardizes the credibility of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement system and must serve as a wake-up call for the administration,'' Mr. Levin said.   In Congressional hearings today, steel officials and union representatives praised the tariffs. Leo W. Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers of America, told lawmakers that they should not forget the history that led to the president's decision to impose the steel tariffs. For several years, he said, the domestic steel industry was ''under attack from foreign producers, aided and abetted by foreign governments through subsidies and other market manipulations.''   ''The consequences of this assault have been disastrous for our steelworkers and for the American steel industry,'' Mr. Gerard said.   The result, he said, was that 37 companies were forced into bankruptcy, 54,000 steel workers lost their jobs, and pension plans and health care programs were being scaled back for retirees, widows and other dependents.   But some manufacturers have complained that the tariffs have led to higher prices for steel and hurt their companies.   Wes Smith, the president of the E&E Manufacturing Company, with 250 employees in Plymouth, Mich., testified that the tariffs and rising cost of steel amounted to a new tax for him.   ''We are willing to meet the challenge of competing with the Asians,'' Mr. Smith said. ''However, we cannot do that with our hands tied behind our backs by having our government tax our largest input by 30 percent.''  ART",[],hr
33373,"If you listened to the Republican candidates this year, you heard a conventional set of arguments. But if you go online, you can find a vibrant and increasingly influential center-right conversation. Most of the young writers and bloggers in this conversation intermingle, but they can be grouped, for clarity's sake, around a few hot spots: Paleoconservatives. The American Conservative has become one of the more dynamic spots on the political Web. Writers like Rod Dreher and Daniel Larison tend to be suspicious of bigness: big corporations, big government, a big military, concentrated power and concentrated wealth. Writers at that Web site, and at the temperamentally aligned Front Porch Republic, treasure tight communities and local bonds. They're alert to the ways capitalism can erode community. Dispositionally, they are more Walker Percy than Pat Robertson. TD Larison focuses on what he calls the imperial tendencies of both the Bush and Obama foreign policies. He crusades against what he sees as the unchecked killing power of drone strikes and champions a more modest and noninterventionist foreign policy. Lower-Middle Reformists. Reihan Salam, a writer for National Review, E21 and others, recently pointed out that there are two stories about where the Republican Party should go next. There is the upper-middle reform story: Republicans should soften their tone on the social issues to win over suburban voters along the coasts. Then there is a lower-middle reform story: Republicans should focus on the specific economic concerns of the multiethnic working class. Salam promotes the latter. This means acknowledging that working-class concerns are not what they were in the 1980s. The income tax is less burdensome than the payroll tax. Family disruption undermines social mobility. Republicans, he argues, should keep the social conservatism, which reinforces families, and supplement it with an agenda that supports upward mobility and social capital. Similarly, Henry Olsen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued for a Republican Party that listens more closely to working-class concerns. Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review has argued for family-friendly tax credits and other measures that reinforce middle-class dignity. Jim Manzi wrote a seminal article in National Affairs on the need to promote innovation while reducing inequality. Soft Libertarians. Some of the most influential bloggers on the right, like Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok and Megan McArdle, start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way. Many of these market-oriented writers emphasize that being pro-market is not the same as being pro-business. Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago published an influential book, ''A Capitalism for the People,'' that took aim at crony capitalism. Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner does muckraking reporting on corporate-federal collusion. Rising star Derek Khanna wrote a heralded paper on intellectual property rights for the House Republican Study Committee that was withdrawn by higher-ups in the party, presumably because it differed from the usual lobbyist-driven position. There are a number of unpredictable libertarian-leaning writers, including Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic on civil liberties issues, and Eugene Volokh on legal and free speech concerns. Burkean Revivalists. This group includes young conservatives whose intellectual roots go back to the organic vision of society described best by Edmund Burke but who are still deeply enmeshed in current policy debates. Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs is one of the two or three most influential young writers in politics today. He argues that we are now witnessing the fiscal crisis of the entitlement state, exemplified most of all by exploding health care costs. His magazine promotes a big agenda of institutional modernization. The lawyer Adam J. White has argued for an approach to jurisprudence and regulatory affairs based on modesty, but not a doctrinaire clinging to original intent. Ryan Streeter of Indiana champions civil-society conservatism, an updated version of the Jack Kemp style. By and large, these diverse writers did not grow up in the age of Reagan and are not trying to recapture it. They disdain what you might call Donor Base Republicanism. Most important, they matured intellectually within a far-reaching Web-based conversation. In contrast to many members of the conservative political-entertainment complex, they are data-driven, empirical and low-key in tone. They are united more by a style of feedback and mutual scrutiny than by a common agenda. Some politically unorthodox people in this conversation, such as Josh Barro of Bloomberg View, Meghan Clyne of National Affairs and Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute, specialize in puncturing sentimentality and groupthink. Since Nov. 6, the G.O.P. has experienced an epidemic of open-mindedness. The party may evolve quickly. If so, it'll be powerfully influenced by people with names like Reihan, Ramesh, Yuval and Derek Khanna.

The City Council voted 5 to 4 late Monday to put the ''Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance'' to a vote.

33375,"WASHINGTON -- Senator Barack Obama informed two of his top three vice-presidential prospects Friday night that he would not be choosing them, Democratic officials said, encouraging a consensus within the party that he had settled on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. Mr. Obama's campaign and aides to Mr. Biden declined to comment. But Mr. Obama's notification to the two other candidates -- Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia -- was confirmed by senior associates of both men. TD The formal announcement was scheduled to be made in the form of text messages and e-mail messages sent to thousands of Obama supporters early Saturday. Mr. Obama and his running mate are scheduled to appear at an afternoon rally at the Old Statehouse in Springfield, Ill., the same place where Mr. Obama announced his candidacy for president 18 months ago. Mr. Obama's selection process has been so secretive that most people in his campaign headquarters still did not know what was going on Friday evening. Democrats were not ruling out the possibility that Mr. Obama could surprise the party with a choice other than Mr. Biden. Should Mr. Obama in fact chose Mr. Biden, he would be moving to plug what many Democrats see as a hole in his resume, turning to a six-term senator who is a leading authority on foreign policy. Mr. Biden's selection would amount to a critical strategic choice: to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about shortfalls in Mr. Obama's background, rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce Mr. Obama's message of change. Mr. Biden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and moves easily among foreign leaders and diplomats. Although he initially voted to authorize the war -- Mr. Obama has opposed the war from the start -- Mr. Biden has become a persistent critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq. Mr. Biden would complement Mr. Obama's antiwar position in the general election match-up against Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee, who has supported the war. Mr. Biden has a reputation for at times talking himself into trouble, and he was not always seen as a natural partner for Mr. Obama. A year ago, when he was himself running for the White House, Mr. Biden said Mr. Obama was ''not yet ready'' for the presidency. Some associates of Mr. Biden were informed by the Obama campaign to stand ready for television interviews on Saturday. Mr. Biden is Catholic, giving him appeal to that important voting bloc, though he favors abortion rights. He was born in Scranton, Pa., a swing state where he remains well known. Mr. Biden is up for re-election to the Senate this year, and he would presumably run for both positions simultaneously were he on the presidential ticket. Mr. Biden was elected to the Senate in 1972 when he was 29 and reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in. He served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee before taking over at Foreign Relations and has a long legislative record on issues such as law enforcement in addition to his work on international policy. Mr. Obama is announcing his choice as he moves into a critical stage of his campaign, preparing for the Democratic Party's four-day convention in Denver, which begins Monday. Mr. Obama's aides viewed the introduction of his vice-presidential choice as the beginning of a weeklong stretch in which Mr. Obama hopes to dominate the stage and position himself for the fall campaign. Mr. Biden is on what is by all accounts a relatively short list of possibilities. In addition to Mr. Bayh and Mr. Kaine, Mr. Obama also called Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut on Friday to inform him that he had chosen someone else, according to Democrats familiar with the race. As the selection process moved to an end, a Democrat who had once been viewed as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, whom Mr. Obama had defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- slipped out of contention. While the decision was being closely held inside the Obama campaign, aides across the country were told late Friday to begin informing local officials about the vice-presidential decision on Saturday morning. As the speculation grew, Mr. Obama spent the day in Chicago, practicing his convention speech and having dinner with his family. As he walked into a downtown restaurant, reporters yelled, ''Where's the text?'' He responded with a laugh, not saying a word as he walked inside. The pace of speculation quickened at the end of a day in which Mr. Obama's success at keeping his search secret -- with a combination of campaign discipline and political gamesmanship -- kept the world waiting and guessing. CNN showed a split screen of the homes of people considered to be top contenders as well as Midway Airport in Chicago, where the pick might presumably land at some point. News reports tracked the whereabouts of the families of Mr. Biden and Mr. Bayh with an intensity usually reserved for fleeing felons. After days devoted to reviewing the political pluses and minuses of the possibilities, news reports spiced things up by injecting a new name into the mix, Representative Chet Edwards of Texas, touching off a flurry of analyses. (Associates of Mr. Obama said he was never a serious contender for the nomination. ) On the Fox News Channel, the vice-presidential saga shared the stage with stories like the one about a North Carolina man who caught a record catfish with his granddaughter's Barbie fishing rod. But it was Mr. Obama who was really reeling them in, building the suspense over the choice in a strategic approach that left party operatives straining to decide whether it was a stroke of genius or a miscalculation. But a certain weariness of the vice-presidential game was emerging in some quarters, leaving other Democrats to wonder privately whether Mr. Obama's campaign was getting too cute in playing ''catch me if you can'' with the news media at the expense of a more resonant message on economic issues. Several Democratic strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern that Mr. Obama was losing an opportunity to make the most of the news of his running mate by announcing too closely to the nominating convention. That said, Mr. Obama clearly was not looking to his vice-presidential selection as a major moment in his presidential bid, and the relatively short roll-out, going into the convention, was designed to prevent the second wave of often negative re-examination news stories that follow selections like this. The anticipation of the text message promised by the Obama campaign and the hair-trigger posture of the press did leave some vulnerable to hoaxes. The apparent first big victim: The Wall Street Journal, which posted an urgent bulletin on Friday reporting that Mr. Obama had selected Mr. Kaine as his running mate. It immediately retracted the report, and the paper issued an apology: ''The Journal news department was sent an erroneous announcement about the selection of a vice presidential candidate for Barack Obama. Once we realized the announcement was erroneous, we immediately withdrew the headline. We regret any inconvenience this caused our readers.''

33377,"Most contributors to political campaigns are probably unaware that their money, under federal and state laws, can be used for all sorts of purposes. It can be channeled to other candidates, stored away for a future campaign or spent on unrelated expenses. A prominent New Jersey politician recently tried to use campaign funds to pay his defense lawyers. The state's election officials were right to turn him down.     Wayne R. Bryant, a former Democratic state senator, has been charged by federal prosecutors with using his position to get a no-show job at the state's medical college. Prosecutors say he showed his gratitude by directing millions of dollars in grants to the school. Mr. Bryant, a former chair of the appropriations committee, who apparently knows no shame, asked the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission for permission to pay his legal bills from his campaign coffers.     TD The request is unacceptable on its face. When people contribute to a candidate, they are being asked to support the democratic process. It is unlikely that they are expecting their dollars to help their preferred candidate fend off federal corruption charges.     Elected officials have to be able to raise money for legal defense funds. When they do, however, they should tell prospective contributors that their money will be used to pay lawyers' bills.     Mr. Bryant isn't the only politician willing to take such advantage of his contributors. At the federal level, former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, used campaign funds to help pay for his defense against bribery charges. More recently, Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, used campaign money to pay lawyers' fees related to his well-known encounter at an airport men's room.     Mr. Bryant argued that his criminal charges arose out of his work as an officeholder. But it is a very dim view of public service to say that contributors should expect that a candidate may naturally face criminal charges. New Jersey's commission, to its credit, refused to go along, but this should not be a gray area. Lawmakers in New Jersey and in Washington should expressly bar the use of campaign contributions to pay legal bills.     Until then, we would at least like to see some truth in advertising. If candidates want to preserve their options, they should be required to tell contributors that their money will go to one of two important causes: giving the people the best possible quality of government or, failing that, fighting to keep themselves out of jail.

33378,"WASHINGTON -- Government investigators said Friday that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state, stating unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Mrs. Clinton has said for months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house so she would not have to carry both a personal phone and a work phone. Her campaign said Friday that any government secrets found on the server had been classified after the fact. TD But the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies said the information they found was classified when it was sent and remains so now. Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and such information can be sent or stored only on computer networks with special safeguards. ''This classified information never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,'' Steve A. Linick, the State Department inspector general, said in a statement signed by him and I. Charles McCullough III, the inspector general for the intelligence community. The findings by the two inspectors general raise new questions about Mrs. Clinton's use of her personal email at the State Department, a practice that since March has been criticized by her Republican adversaries as well as advocates of open government, and has made some Democrats uneasy. Voters, however, do not appear swayed by the issue, according to polls. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said the classified information had originated with the nation's intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. It is against the law for someone to receive a classified document or briefing and then summarize that information in an unclassified email. The two investigators did not say whether Mrs. Clinton sent or received the emails. If she received them, it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified. The inspectors general did not address whether they believed Mrs. Clinton should have known such information was not appropriate for her personal email. Regardless, the disclosure is an example of an unforeseen consequence of Mrs. Clinton's unusual computer setup. Security experts have questioned whether her practice made government secrets more vulnerable to security risks and hacking. Exactly how much classified information Mrs. Clinton had on the server is unclear. Investigators said they searched a small sample of 40 emails and found four that contained government secrets. But Mr. McCullough said in a separate statement that although the State Department had granted limited access to its own inspector general, the department rejected Mr. McCullough's request for access to the 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton said were government-related and gave to the State Department. Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, is ''purported'' to also have copies of the 30,000 emails on a thumb drive, according to Mr. McCullough. Campaigning in New York on Friday, Mrs. Clinton pledged to cooperate with inquiries into her emails, but also said she would stay focused on the issues at the heart of her presidential campaign. ''We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But I'm also going to stay focused on the issues, particularly the big issues, that really matter to American families.'' The discovery of the four emails prompted Mr. McCullough to refer the matter to F.B.I. counterintelligence agents, who investigate crimes related to the mishandling of classified information. On Thursday night and again Friday morning, the Justice Department referred to the matter as a ''criminal referral,'' but later Friday dropped the word ''criminal.'' The inspectors general said late Friday that it was a ''security referral'' intended to alert authorities that ''classified information may exist on at least one private server and thumb drive that are not in the government's possession.'' Irrespective of the terminology, the referral raises the possibility of a Justice Department investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails as she campaigns for president. Polls show she is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by a wide margin. Mishandling classified information is a crime. Justice Department officials said no decision had been made about whether to open a criminal investigation. The refusal by the State Department to give Mr. McCullough access to the emails has reignited calls by Republicans for Mrs. Clinton to hand over the server that she used to house the personal email account. ''If Secretary Clinton truly has nothing to hide, she can prove it by immediately turning over her server to the proper authorities and allowing them to examine the complete record,'' Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on Friday. ''Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing.'' The Justice Department is typically reluctant to open politically charged investigations unless there is clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing. For example, authorities said last year that they would not open an investigation into dueling claims by the C.I.A. and the Senate Intelligence Committee in a dispute that also centered around access to classified information.

33379,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 -- Federal officials moved to step up security at financial centers and federal buildings in Washington and the New York City area on Monday in response to new intelligence about possible threats by Al Qaeda, even as some terrorism experts worried that the increased security might simply prompt terrorists to choose other targets.   ''You harden one target, you soften another,'' said John Gannon, the former deputy director for intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency who is staff director for the House Homeland Security Committee.   TD ''We've got our finger in the dike in the right places on this one, but we have to look for other holes that the terrorists might come through,'' said Mr. Gannon, who was briefed over the weekend on the increased terror threat.   Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security, plans to meet on Tuesday in Manhattan with Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, as well as chief executives from leading companies, and he will review new measures put in place to guard financial institutions, officials said.   On Sunday, Mr. Ridge raised the threat level to the second highest, orange, or ''high risk,'' for the financial sectors in New York City, northern New Jersey and Washington because of intelligence pointing to Qaeda reconnaissance missions aimed at the financial industry. Mr. Ridge listed five potential targets, including the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup buildings in Manhattan.   ''The secretary wants to see firsthand the new protective measures that have been put in place and offer employees a message of reassurance,'' said Brian Roehrkasse, the department's spokesman.   Domestic security officials continued working with local law enforcement agencies and private institutions in Washington and the New York area on Monday to bolster security in and around the financial institutions by increasing visitor inspections, camera surveillance, armed patrols, canine teams and other measures, officials said.   Even before the latest threat information, federal officials were using sophisticated air-monitoring devices at sites in Manhattan, Newark and Washington to help avert biological attacks. The air monitoring will continue, but there is no plan to expand the use of the devices, officials said.   At the same time, federal officials expanded security measures for possible targets beyond the financial sector. Some security personnel who guard federal buildings in New York City and Washington were told to expect increased workloads, officials said. And the Capitol Police said cars traveling through the Capitol complex -- including on Independence and Constitution Avenues -- would have to pass through a cordon of traffic barriers and police officers.   Chief Terrance W. Gainer of the United States Capitol Police said at a news conference on Monday that most vehicles would be allowed to pass slowly but that some could be pulled aside to be searched. One section of First Street on the Senate side of the Capitol will be closed north of Constitution to D Street.   Chief Gainer said 300 officers would be involved in the new security steps, which also include 14 vehicle checkpoints around the Capitol, and the costs could reach $3 million a month. Officials said the moves were long overdue but not directly related to Sunday's raised threat level.   A principal goal, officials said, is visibility.   ''It's important to send the message out to the public and to the terrorists that these are not soft targets,'' said one homeland security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''These are hardened targets, and that acts as a deterrent.''   Officials said they believe that increased visibility and public awareness could help to disrupt a terrorist plot or to discourage terrorists from carrying one out, as officials think happened when a suspected Qaeda operative believed to be studying the Brooklyn Bridge in 2003 reported that security was ''too hot.''   But with increased security at financial centers like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, there comes the risk that plotters could switch plans and pick a new target.   In the past, security and intelligence experts said, Al Qaeda has proved adept at shifting its targets in response to tightened security.   ''The problem is that they will take whatever time is necessary to get their operatives in place,'' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University at San Bernardino who studies terrorism and consults with the federal government on the issue.   ''Half this battle is psychological, and the mere show of force by the government at these locations will put people temporarily at ease,'' Professor Levin said. ''But in the long term, the difficulty you face is that people get complacent and things go back to business as usual, and that's what the terrorists want.''   Domestic security officials said they had no clear indication how long the code-orange alert would remain in place because the intelligence -- gathered from a recent arrest of a suspected Qaeda computer engineer in Pakistan -- did not indicate when a plot might be carried out.   ''We'll continue to assess the threats, and we'll see where it leads us,'' Mr. Roehrkasse said.   NS",[],hr

33381,"Like many areas around the country, Washington and its suburbs are embracing positive momentum in data on infections to push ahead. WASHINGTON -- The leaders around the nation's capital are pushing forward with plans to reopen the region, hoping they are close enough to their public health goals to move toward normalcy despite coronavirus infection rates that have alarmed federal officials. TD ''I want to make sure we all understand that moving into Phase 1 means that more people can get infected,'' Muriel E. Bowser, Washington's mayor, said on Wednesday as she announced that parts of the city would begin to reopen on Friday. ''It cannot be said enough: Every single one of us has a role to play.'' The northern suburbs of Virginia will also begin limited reopenings on Friday, while suburban counties in Maryland remain shuttered, underscoring the challenges that the region faces with boundaries that its residents crisscross daily. The Washington metropolitan area, home to 6.2 million people, is among the most interconnected regions in the nation, with a shared public transportation system and entwined economies. The region's unusual symbiosis is further complicated by the movements of congressional lawmakers in and out of town and a mercurial White House, all posing difficulties for the governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor of the District of Columbia -- a city that lacks the autonomy of states with the same or smaller populations -- as they move to bring their economies back to life. On Tuesday, in a private call with the nation's governors, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, singled out the Washington region as among a handful of metropolitan areas where positive coronavirus test rates remain above 10 percent. In the call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Birx also mentioned Baltimore and Richmond, the largest nearby cities. On Wednesday, Virginia reported 45 new deaths, the third day in a row of record increases. A majority of them were in the Washington suburbs, where the overall number of infections remains far higher than in the rest of the commonwealth. Nonetheless, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has said that because Northern Virginia health officials judged that the region had met four of the six metrics for reopening, the area would begin to do so on Friday, joining the less-affected parts of the commonwealth. That day, Virginia will also begin a statewide mask requirement for indoor businesses. The growth rates of new cases and deaths in the District of Columbia have mostly held steady at a time when rates have mostly fallen elsewhere in the country, underscoring the city's difficulty in fully reversing the course of the virus, as Dr. Birx would like to see. In Maryland, the two counties bordering Washington have opted to maintain stay-at-home orders as Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has moved to slowly open the state while leaving counties to decide their own path. On Wednesday, Marc Elrich, the county executive in Montgomery County, a sprawling and diverse suburb across the district line where the most Maryland deaths have occurred, said it would begin restricted reopenings in ''a matter of days.'' Another close-in suburb, Prince George's County -- which has nearly 30 percent of Maryland's cases even though it holds only 15 percent of the state's population -- is expected to take similar measures soon. A much-celebrated tranche of tests that Mr. Hogan procured from South Korea has not really made its way into the Maryland counties as many local leaders expected, and the counties closest to the nation's capital -- areas with the highest rates of infection and death -- have scrambled to obtain their own tests. ''Maryland's high positive infection rate, one of the highest in the country, shows just how limited our state's testing capacity is,'' said Representative Anthony G. Brown, a Democrat. ''We are not testing beyond our sickest residents, leaving us mostly blind to the broader community spread that is likely occurring.'' ''Local jurisdictions,'' he said, ''have been left to fend for themselves to get adequate testing and medical supplies in place. This is a threat to public health.'' Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan, noted that the governor had said that some components were still needed for the tests, which he got through a contact of his wife, to be used widely around the state. ''We have consistently directed much of the state's response to hardest-hit areas, with Montgomery and Prince George's receiving the most testing, the most hospitals,'' he said. In Washington, the racial disparities in death rates have been stark. For instance, Ward 4, a neighborhood with a mix of poor, middle-class and wealthy residents, has more infections -- 1,771 total -- than any other, largely attributed to workers in so-called essential jobs who take public transportation and often live in dense environments. But there have been only 63 deaths in that area. In Ward 8, one of the city's poorest areas, the 1,174 cases are in the middle of infection rates for the city's eight wards, but the number of deaths, 92, is the highest in the city. The difference, local health care experts said, most likely stems from the fact that Ward 4 is 47 percent black, while Ward 8 is 92 percent black. The city's black residents are more likely to be obese and have diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, all major risk factors for death with the coronavirus. ''I would add to the resource issue the black population's historically complex relationship with health care,'' said Yesim Sayin Taylor, the executive director of the D.C. Policy Center, a research organization. Ward 8 has far fewer health care resources than the rest of the city, and many residents may be getting tested for the coronavirus at a far later stage than other city residents. Poverty among black residents in Ward 8 may help explain why their death rates are higher than those of black residents in Prince George's County, where infection rates are high but deaths lag Montgomery County. Black residents make up about 62 percent of the Prince George's population, but income levels are higher. ''Wealth allows families to weather an unexpected emergency like Covid-19,'' said Danyelle Solomon, the vice president for race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. She noted that in Washington, black residents were 4.5 times more likely to experience poverty than their white counterparts, while in Maryland they were two times more likely. ''It has long been known that only 15 to 20 percent of good health is determined by medical care, and the other 80 percent is determined by the social determinants of health,'' said George A. Jones, the chief executive of Bread for the City, which provides food and services for poor residents of Washington. ''There is a phenomenon called 'weathering' that is used to describe African-Americans' poor health outcomes.'' Weathering ''is caused by the chronic stress of economic and social struggles, which accelerates the rate of health decline,'' he said. ''Racism in social and economic systems creates a chronic stress that causes worse health outcomes.'' ART",[],hr
33382,"Yes, the American military still uses bayonets, and quite a few. There are horses too. When Mitt Romney complained during Monday night's presidential debate that the Navy ""is smaller now than at any time since 1917,"" President Obama shot back with ""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.'' Mr. Obama's line, meant to underscore that military capability matters more than sheer numbers, quickly ignited a fire on the Internet. TD Marines quickly jumped in to say that they still attach bayonets to the end of their rifles, either the M4, M16 or M27. Of course, Mr. Obama did not say that the military has no bayonets and horses at all -- just that there were fewer now than then. While that is almost certainly true (the United States government drafted four million men in World War I), the 2012 United States Marine Corps still has more than 175,000 bayonets - or nearly one for each of the 197,500 current active-duty Marines. Marines carry bayonets when they deploy overseas, typically in sheaths attached to their body armor. In the martial arts training that all Marines receive, they are taught to attach them to their rifles in difficult or close-quarters situations. ""Basically when you're in a hand-to-hand-combat situation, if you're out of ammo and if your rifle malfunctions, you can attach the bayonet and still kill somebody,'' said Capt. Kendra Motz, a Marine Corps spokeswoman. The bayonet blade is 7 inches long. Horses are still used for funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and in formal military parades. One of their most well-known uses in recent years was in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, when elite teams of American commandos on horseback radioed in airstrikes to American pilots with the enemy's exact position. As for the Navy, Mr. Romney is right that it is the smallest since 1917, the year the United States entered World War I. The war buildup is easy to see in Navy statistics: In 1917 there were 342 ships in the Navy compared with 245 ships the year before. At the end of 2011, there were 285 ships in the Navy. That's a slight increase from the George W. Bush administration, when in 2007 there were 278 ships. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. NS",[],hr
33383,"Washington Tax Break Urged for Firms That Keep Health Benefits A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including the chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House and the Senate, asked the Internal Revenue Service on Monday to allow companies that continue paying the cost of health benefits for furloughed workers to remain eligible for a new tax credit. The tax credit essentially reimburses companies for up to half the wages they continue to pay workers who are furloughed amid the coronavirus pandemic. The credit, meant to encourage companies to keep paying workers amid virus-induced shutdowns, was part of an economic rescue package that passed Congress with bipartisan support. President Trump signed it in March. The lawmakers' concern stems from guidance that I.R.S. officials issued governing which companies are eligible for the credit, and to what degree. Companies qualify if they reduce employees' hours -- and thus, their pay -- amid the pandemic, but do not lay them off entirely. But it rules out benefits for companies that stop paying wages to their workers but continue to pay the cost of their health benefits. If a company ''is not paying wages to its employees for time that the employees are not providing services,'' the guidance states, ''it may not treat any portion of the health plan expenses as qualified wages.'' In a letter to the I.R.S., Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Finance Committee chairman, along with others, said that finding runs counter to the clear intent that members of Congress had expressed in crafting the law. ''We urge you to reconsider this determination,'' the lawmakers wrote, ''in light of congressional intent and the importance of providing access to affordable health care during the ongoing health crisis.'' Technology Britain Tests App On Isle of Wight The Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast, is renowned for a beautiful coastline and balmy climate, drawing crowds of summer tourists from across Britain. And it is now at the forefront of national attention for a different reason: The British government is preparing to begin a trial there this week of a mobile app that will track the contacts of people infected with the coronavirus. The app uses Bluetooth to ''alert people if they have been near somebody who is later diagnosed with having coronavirus,'' Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Sunday. The tracking system will be rolled out by the National Health Service, and if the trials are successful, it will be available this month throughout the country. Antibody Testing F.D.A. Presses for Data On Accuracy of Results The Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that companies selling coronavirus antibody tests must submit data proving accuracy within the next 10 days or face removal from the market. The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been infected with the coronavirus, but results have been widely varied. Since mid-March, the agency has permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing evidence that they are accurate. The F.D.A.'s action follows a report by more than 50 scientists, which found that only three out of 14 antibody tests gave consistently reliable results, and even the best had flaws. An evaluation by the National Institutes of Health, working with other federal health agencies, has also found ''a concerning number'' of commercial tests that are performing poorly, the F.D.A. said. The agency has also been under fire from Congress, with numerous lawmakers raising questions about the validity of some of the tests. While 12 companies have been given F.D.A. clearance to sell the antibody tests, many other products do not have agency authorization. The result has been a confusing landscape in which tests by established companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Cellex and most recently, Roche Diagnostics, are competing with unapproved tests made by unknown companies and sold by U.S. distributors with spotty track records. The F.D.A. has blocked imports of some antibody tests at the U.S. border, and has ordered some distributors to revise claims about what individuals can learn from them, or halt sales. NS",[],hr
33384,"WASHINGTON -- Two days after Democratic senators blocked it, the Senate voted on Thursday to take up legislation that would grant the president negotiating freedom to complete an expansive trade accord with 11 nations on the Pacific Rim, setting off a contentious congressional debate on one of President Obama's top priorities for his remaining time in office. While the motion to consider the legislation passed 65-33, that belied how hard the coming weeks will be for the White House. Most Democrats, including the top three Democratic leaders in the Senate, voted against even opening debate to give Mr. Obama so-called trade promotion authority. TD And before the vote, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, suggested that she could not accept a bill that would keep the door open to negotiate trade deals for three years, and possibly six, well into the next administration. ''While three years in the trade promotion authority bill may be appropriate for foreseeable trade agreements, there is unease with a process that would provide carte blanche for agreements unknown, for countries to be determined, for a time in perpetuity,'' she said. The stakes in the larger trade agreement are substantial for American business interests, including Boeing, Nike, the pharmaceutical industry, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Most corporate interests are strongly pushing for the Pacific Rim accord. Labor groups say it would cost Americans jobs and erode wages. The Senate reversed itself on the matter two hours after senators broadly approved legislation that would crack down on countries that manipulate their currency rates, putting bipartisan pressure on House leaders to take up a measure that Mr. Obama argues could scuttle the delicate Pacific trade talks. The trade votes on Thursday were starkly different from the first effort to take up the issue on Tuesday. Then, Senate Democrats united against even considering trade promotion authority, to provide for ''fast track'' approval of trade deals, defying their own president and holding out for assurances that tough enforcement provisions would be attached to that authority. What they got instead was a compromise to allow the currency provision to come to a vote in a separate bill that now faces an even steeper climb than the fast-track bill. Even if a bipartisan majority can pressure Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio to allow a House vote on the currency measure, the White House has expressed opposition. A formal White House statement of policy on Thursday, however, stopped short of a veto threat. But by separating the currency bill from the decision to proceed, Senate leaders moved closer to granting the president the authority he seeks. ''Under our plan, the Senate will avoid the poison pills that had been floated in favor of the very type of bipartisan approach we've been advocating for all along,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, said. ''It allows senators to express themselves without endangering more American trade jobs for the people we represent.'' The vote on Thursday to take up trade promotion authority begins a difficult process of securing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade deal in more than two decades. It would put countries from Canada to Chile, Japan to Australia -- while excluding China, at least for now -- under an economic umbrella representing 40 percent of the world's economy. Obama administration officials say an accord cannot be reached until Congress assures the White House and the other nations involved that any trade deal cannot be amended by lawmakers, though it could be rejected. Next week, senators will try to put new demands on those final negotiations. Senators Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, and Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, still want American negotiators to be required to include a chapter in the trade pact forbidding the intentional deflation of a country's currency to make its exports cheaper and United States exports more expensive. Mr. Portman, a trade representative in the George W. Bush administration, acknowledged the opposition of Republican leaders and the White House. ''It's wrongheaded,'' he said. ''I think they should be embracing this to get more support.'' The Senate voted 78-20 on a broad trade enforcement bill that included a crackdown on countries that manipulate their currency. The currency provision would require the Commerce Department to investigate claims by American companies that competitor nations are manipulating their currency to promote their own industries. And if manipulation is found, the government would have to impose tariffs to raise the cost of imports to compensate for the currency price imbalance. But the White House insists that a more diplomatic approach should be pursued. ''Those provisions would undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic questions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer,'' a White House statement released on Thursday said. Even supporters said that vote was intended more to allow lawmakers to express their frustration on the currency issue. The real showdown will be over the Portman-Stabenow amendment attached to the trade promotion authority itself. If that reached Mr. Obama's desk, supporters say, the president would have to sign it. ''That currency bill is going nowhere,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. ''Portman's the real deal. That's firing with real bullets.'' The trade enforcement legislation includes the creation of an interagency trade enforcement center and a system to respond faster to unfair trade practices, like the dumping of exports at prices below the cost of production. Another provision would require the Customs and Border Protection agency to expeditiously investigate allegations of customs duty evasion. Still another would close a 75-year-old loophole that allows the importation of goods produced with child labor if a company cannot find those goods elsewhere. The Senate separately approved an extension of an African trade preference law, 97-1, intended to expand economic ties with that continent. The House speaker, who has long been at odds with Mr. Obama, looks as of he intends to be a bulwark for the White House on this issue. ''We've had this discussion about currency between countries and continents for the 25 years that I've been here, and to think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday. Democrats and Republicans in both congressional chambers disagree. Ms. Stabenow took to the Senate floor to argue that Japan's weak yen is effectively raising the price of American automobiles there. ''Currency manipulation is the most significant 21st-century trade barrier that American businesses and workers face today, and it is the least enforced against,'' she said. Ms. Pelosi expressed her own frustration with the White House. ''The administration has been pretty clear that they don't want this in the bill,'' she said. ''We keep saying, 'Well, what other suggestions do you have?' '' ''There is a general belief,'' she added, ''that currency manipulation has been responsible for the loss of many jobs in this country.'' Such talk has administration officials worried and playing defense. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said Japan has refrained in recent years from the kind of blatant currency manipulation it practiced in the past. And China, which has closely managed its own currency, has let the renminbi rise against the dollar. The Obama administration is walking a tightrope. Congress could give Mr. Obama the authority he needs to conclude a Pacific trade agreement that he sees as a central element to enhance the administration's strategic role in Asia. But officials say that the demands imposed by Congress could scare off key partners such as Japan and Malaysia just as the deal comes into reach. NS",[],hr
33385,"CITY COUNCIL meetings in Austin, Tex., tend to be droning, low-drama affairs, but that wasn't the case earlier this month when barbecue was on the agenda: specifically, the smell of barbecue and a proposal to control it, in response to some citizen complaints. The suggestion that a smell some would dab behind their ears if possible should be mitigated by special exhaust systems called smoke-scrubbers provoked local outrage, with opponents accusing the complainers of being from California (in Texas, that's not a compliment). TD But that's the thing about smells. One person's putrid is another person's pleasant, and local governments around the country are having a hard time regulating what's in the olfaction of the beholder. If you time-traveled back 200 years or so, you'd likely scrunch up your nose. Our forebears threw sewage out their windows, and the primary mode of transport -- horses -- relieved themselves all over the street. And let's not even discuss the pervasive smell of rotting food in the prerefrigeration era. These days there is a product called Poo-Pourri (toilet odor inhibitor), and people place their dogs' business in knotted plastic bags. Moreover, food that is mildly bruised, wilted or minutes past its sell-by date is dispatched to a landfill long before it can produce the slightest offending odor. ''We have so reduced the level of background odor pollution, we are becoming more sensitive to anything we smell,'' said Pamela Dalton, an olfactory researcher at Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit group in Philadelphia that studies smell and taste. Just 20 years ago, you might not have noticed someone smoking in the same restaurant where you were dining, whereas today you'd likely detect the residual odor of cigarette smoke on the clothes of someone simply walking past your table. Over the years attempts by states and municipalities to regulate odor have led to a patchwork of legal guidelines subjectively enforced by inspectors who sniff the air and determine whether to make a stink about a stink. In the past the offenders were typically livestock operations and wastewater treatment plants, but more recently odor inspectors are getting calls about smells emanating from ethnic restaurants, coffee roasters and candle and bath shops. In an effort to be more objective, a growing number of locales have begun using a device called a Nasal Ranger, which looks like a megaphone for the nose and measures the intensity of smells according to a so-called dilution ratio. An odor is considered intrusive if the average person can smell it when it is diluted with seven parts clean air -- a decades-old threshold of stinky, the origin of which no one I spoke to can quite recall. ''Unless we're talking a rendering facility or asphalt plant, it's rare to find anything that exceeds a seven to one ratio,'' said Ben Siller, a licensed smell investigator with the Denver office of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. His city's odor ordinance also considers it a violation if his department receives more than five complaints from different households about a smell within a 12-hour period. And that has been happening more often lately because of marijuana growing operations, recently made legal in the state. ''It has a strong musky, skunky odor when they are drying and curing the leaves,'' Mr. Siller said. ''But even that only registers two to one on the Nasal Ranger,'' which he added is the same ratio registered when his neighborhood bakery bakes cinnamon rolls, and ''I never get a call about that.'' That's because whether we like or dislike a smell depends primarily on the context and associations we have with it. Unlike other senses, smell has a direct and immediate link to the limbic system, the part of the brain that produces emotions. Thus, smelling something triggers overwhelmingly strong feelings before we are even consciously aware we smelled something. As Rudyard Kipling said, ''Smells are surer than sights or sounds to make your heart-strings crack.'' Which brings us back to the complaints about the barbecue smell in Austin. Although you might love the smell of slow-smoked brisket because of its association with satiation and good times with family and friends, you can come to hate it if you are forced to smell it when and where you don't want or expect to. ''The smell becomes highly offensive because of the distress of being exposed against your free will,'' said Rachel Herz, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Brown University and author of ''The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell.'' ''It's similar to your neighbor blaring a song you once liked loudly and constantly.'' A spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection said that of the more than 10,000 odor complaints that came in last year, many were from residents upset about cooking smells wafting into their apartments from restaurants and coffeehouses -- smells that might be pleasing when patronizing those same establishments. ''A lot of it has to do with tolerance level in neighborhoods that are getting gentrified,'' said Mr. Siller in Denver. ''People at lower socioeconomic levels may tolerate something much better than someone who moves into the same area and buys a house, sinks a fortune into remodeling and then goes out in the backyard and smells a pot grower, charbroiler, pet food manufacturer or something stinky like that.'' If a smell is part of a plume that contains particulates or other irritants, then it can cause inflammatory- and allergic-type reactions. But researchers said, for the most part, it's the stress of smelling something you don't want to that makes people feel sick. Physiological symptoms might include headaches, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure. Psychologically, it tends to make people feel depressed, anxious and irritable. Case law on odor liability is mixed, with courts sometimes finding in favor of plaintiffs (sniffers) and other times defendants (emitters), as well as ruling for and against insurance companies, which typically claim odors are pollution and thus not covered under many policies. Recent cases in Manhattan pitting apartment building residents against odoriferous downstairs restaurants have ended in undisclosed monetary settlements and improved ventilation systems. But there are also cases that went to trial, like that of Maxine Furs in Birmingham, Ala., which failed to recoup $350,000 in cleaning costs after its inventory was infused with the smell of curry from a neighboring Indian food restaurant. ''The smell of Indian food makes me sick now,'' said John Pechi, owner of Maxine Furs. While there are technologies to control and deodorize odorous emissions, they are often prohibitively expensive, particularly for small businesses. That's why Austin's City Council decided to study further the proposal that would require barbecue joints to install them. At Franklin Barbecue in Austin, where on a recent Saturday lines started forming at 9:30 a.m., the owner, Aaron Franklin, said the solution is for businesses to be good neighbors. ''Our smokers are on the second floor so the smell dissipates before it drifts down, and we make sure our fires have a complete combustion so you don't get that gross-smelling creosote,'' he said. ''And we make sure kids in the neighborhood get food for their birthday parties'' so the positive emotional associations with the smell of his barbecue get imprinted early.

33386,"BOSTON -- More than a few eyebrows will likely be raised on Thursday when the Italian architect Renzo Piano unveils his design for the expansion of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here. The cultural watchdogs of Boston don't take well to change. And the museum, whose collections haven't moved since 1924, is one of the most beloved art institutions in this city. Its eclectic array of artworks from the Middle Ages to the early-20th century, displayed in a dazzling faux-Venetian palazzo, stands alongside those in the Frick Collection in Manhattan and the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif., as a rare -- and intimate -- expression of a single collector's vision. TD Well, the preservationists should put away their torches and pitchforks. Mr. Piano's design, dominated by a four-story copper-clad volume that encloses a 300-seat music hall and a temporary-exhibitions gallery, keeps a respectful distance from the Venetian dowager. And the new building's strong geometric forms should make a welcome counterpoint to the old one, which, from the outside at least, has always seemed a bit bland. If the design has a flaw, it's not that it tramples all over Gardner's memory, but that it holds it in too high regard. Mr. Piano has been so careful to protect the sanctity of the existing museum in his design that you may find yourself tiptoeing through the galleries instead of floating joyously through them as visitors do today. I doubt Isabella Gardner ever walked around on tiptoe; she was more the type to dance barefoot to Gypsy tunes. Born into a newly rich New York family in 1840, she moved north 20 years later and became known in Boston society as something of an eccentric outsider. After her 1 1/2-year-old son died of pneumonia, she seemed to find solace in the world of musicians, artists and writers; John Singer Sargent and Henry James became friends. She had two qualities that are crucial to building a great collection: an all-consuming curiosity and confidence in her own tastes. She was among the first Americans to collect Renaissance painting, and when men wealthier than Gardner -- like Pierpont Morgan and Henry Clay Frick -- pushed her out of the market, she turned her astute eye to Spanish and Chinese art, amassing formidable collections there too. The museum she built, which opened in 1903, reflects the same independence of mind. Its galleries are centered around a fabulously faux-Venetian courtyard overflowing with tropical and flowering plants, both a reflection of Gardner's catholic tastes and an image of feminine power. A Roman mosaic of Medusa's head dominates the garden. Rows of mismatched Venetian windows -- some real, others fake -- line its pink walls. The barely disguised references to the female realm pile up as you climb to the upper floors. A somber marble staircase is decorated with an ornate wrought-iron railing made from the frame of a bed from an Italian convent. In one upstairs gallery a small, pious painting of Jesus' head, lightly bearing the weight of the cross, is set on a small table just to one side of a wild abduction scene, Titian's ''Europa.'' Underneath is a framed fabric swatch from one of Gardner's ballroom gowns. As splendid and theatrical as the museum is, however, it has suffered over the years. Immediately after Gardner's death the main entry was shifted so that it now lines up with a vaulted side gallery, which meant that visitors lost the impact of stepping from the dark, brick entry corridor directly into the light-filled courtyard. A small bookstore and cafe were stuffed into the back of the first floor in the 1970s. Conservation offices and a temporary gallery are in a small 1930s addition plugged into the back of the museum, an area staff members refer to (not, it seems, with affection) as the doghouse. Meanwhile the number of visitors has grown from a few thousand a year to nearly 200,000. The addition will clear up some of that mess. The bookstore and cafe will be moved to addition's ground floor, and the space at the back of the old museum will eventually return to its original function as a meditative space with Buddhas and Chinese screens. The new music hall means that the second-floor Tapestry Room, which is often used for recitals, can now be returned to its original state. The collections will be freer to breathe. But Mr. Piano has done more, striking an ideal balance between new and old without compromising the identity of either. The addition, whose copper cladding will give it a muscular feel, is set discreetly behind the existing building. A narrow garden, 50 feet wide, separates the two, creating a palpable tension, as between two magnets held slightly apart. That sense of tension is also apparent in the addition, in a constant play between darkness and light, gravity and weightlessness. The ground-floor lobby and commercial spaces will be wrapped entirely in glass, with the copper-clad gallery, music hall and offices resting above. These three spaces will be divided by vertical bands of glass, so that from certain angles they will seem to be breaking apart. (The gorgeousness of these forms may very well be diminished by the treatment of the copper surface; Mr. Piano plans to treat the copper with acid, which will give it a uniformly green finish, rather than letting it age naturally, which would convey a passing of time.) The sense of discrete spaces is enhanced by the treatment of the individual interiors, which feel less uniform in character than those in some of Mr. Piano's earlier museums. The music hall, surrounded by narrow balconies, may be one of his most radical spaces in years. The extreme vertical organization and compactness of the room bring to mind La Fenice in Venice. Because the rigidly symmetrical hall is a square, 44 feet on each side, audience members will be staring directly at one other as well as down toward the stage, an effect that could be pleasingly voyeuristic or distracting; it's hard to tell. For the gallery space Mr. Piano has created a mechanical ceiling that moves up and down so curators can make the room airier or more intimate, depending on the needs of a given show. A high window, facing northeast toward the old building, can be blocked out with a system of computerized shades. Behind the addition Mr. Piano has also designed a giant greenhouse with a sloping glass wall. Conceived as an Arcadia for visiting artists and scholars, it will include a row of apartments and terraces running along the top like little treehouses. Some people, no doubt, will complain that this expansion is yet another example of museum bloat. But my only worry about the design has to do with the way it leads you to the old building's galleries. When the project is complete, sometime in 2011, visitors will no longer be able to approach through the old entry on the Fenway. Instead they will enter the complex through Mr. Piano's new lobby, and from there turn right and follow a glass-enclosed walkway through the garden and into the back of Gardner's palazzo. This significantly lengthens the distance between entry and artworks, which I suspect is intentional. In recent years more and more architects have used an extended architectural narrative to screen out the visual noise of the contemporary city, and in the process prepare visitors mentally for the act of viewing art. But it may also further reduce the impact of Gardner's original vision. The ability to move, in a few short steps, from the darkness of the brick vaulted lobby to the joyous explosion of light that fills the towering pink courtyard is not just a great architectural effect; it is a powerful metaphor for what art can do -- and what it did for her. Mr. Piano has given us a thoughtful, mature, even beautiful, building. And there is no question in my mind that it is necessary. Still, some of us will mourn the loss of that experience.

33387,"To the Editor: Your Aug. 27 editorial ''Dread of Flying'' proclaims the need to diminish congestion on the air side of travel. On the land side, though, we have a solution so obvious and immediate that we usually miss it: high-speed rail. TD For example, numbers gleaned from the Port Authority's ''2006 Airport Traffic Report'' for greater New York indicate that nearly 20 percent of domestic flights from the three major airports fly to the 17 most traveled airports within 350 miles. This significant share does not even include the numerous commuter flights to and from lesser, nearby centers, travel that requires nearly as much airspace as is used by the larger planes. Even at only 150 miles per hour, a 350-mile railroad journey would take less time from door to door than an airplane ride, with greatly reduced stress, delay and cancellation. And let's not forget the comparative carbon footprint. George B. Terrien Rockland, Me., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your aptly titled editorial ''Dread of Flying'' points out that airline passengers ''do expect the term 'estimated time of arrival' to mean something.'' I've always felt that the term should be changed to WNAB: will not arrive before. It's about the only certainty in air travel these days. Marcia Thompson East Falmouth, Mass., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Air-travel delays and the demise of airline efficiency are indeed a product of ''out-of-control congestion,'' but the underlying cause is out-of-control competition. While the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act has benefited consumers in some cases with lower ticket prices, the industry clearly needs a more advanced, specific and supportive regulatory system rather than strictly competitive markets to improve operations. Most industry players, including our current government, bristle at mention of the ''R'' word (regulation), but it is helpful to keep in mind what regulation really is: a concept borrowed from nature that ensures a living thing can function reliably, adapt and grow. The industry requires smart regulation -- including more deliberate coordination between the public and private sectors -- to facilitate efficiency and modernization. That is the truest consumer benefit. Matt Andersson Chicago, Aug. 27, 2007 The writer is president of Indigo Aerospace, an aviation advisory company. To the Editor: Your editorial hits the nail on the head by identifying the trend to fly more smaller aircraft where fewer large aircraft used to go. What is needed at our most congested airports are high-occupancy aircraft (H.O.A.) periods. These would be the most high-demand, overscheduled periods at an airport. An aircraft not having a capacity of, arguably, 175 seats would not be allowed to operate on a designated H.O.A. runway during an H.O.A. period. Aircraft not meeting the minimum capacity would pay a large fine, which would help finance the air-traffic-control system. We do it with commuter lanes on our expressways, so why not do it on our nation's runways? William Maloney Aurora, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your editorial says there is an urgent need to remedy the delays and overcrowding at airports, and that the government should cap the number of aircraft that airports can handle. In the context of concern about global warming, the solution is to drastically cut the amount of aircraft travel. Air transport accounts for about 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, but high-flying airplanes leave contrails that are believed to cause two to four times more global warming than carbon dioxide emissions normally generate. Curtailing air travel these days sounds like a hardship, but in the 1950s we lived comfortably with a small fraction of today's air travel. John Burton Washington, N.J., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: It's not the lack of controlled airspace and the ability of the air-traffic-control system but the shortage of runways at our nation's major airports that is causing congestion and delays. The Federal Aviation Administration has the capacity to handle the number of commercial and private jets that crisscross the nation each day. It just doesn't have the concrete to put the jets on when they arrive or depart from most of our airports. Unfortunately, it's a situation that is not easily resolved because of insufficient real estate and environmental issues that arise when airport expansions are put on the table. It's a chicken-and-egg situation that must be solved to meet the growing needs of America's traveling public. Alfred S. Newman Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: While you accurately report a 24 percent increase in traffic in and out of Kennedy Airport since October, another statistic should be included: the 27 percent drop in the number of certified professional controllers at the airport. In 2004, Kennedy had 37 controllers; today there are 27. By the end of next summer there will be 21, all responsible for the predicted 1,500 aircraft landings and takeoffs a day. This staffing profile is found at almost every air-traffic-control facility in the United States as staffing continues to drop while volume increases, creating lower safety margins. While safety will always be a controller's No. 1 priority, we are being put into positions where chances for mistakes are greatly increased. The decreasing number of controllers will go on as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues its oppressive jailhouselike working conditions. Stephen J.

33388,"WASHINGTON, March 15 -- Senator John Kerry has conspicuously avoided speaking out on the terrorist attacks in Spain and the fall of the government there, a departure from his practice of trying to use the events of the day to bolster his case against President Bush.   All year, Mr. Kerry has argued that the war in Iraq has diverted resources and attention away from what should have been devoted to a more pernicious target, terrorist groups, and he has accused the president of squandering alliances that previous administrations carefully cultivated.   TD Yet in a 25-minute speech on Monday about terrorism and domestic security to the International Association of Firefighters, the senator mentioned the events in Spain only in passing. He accused the president of being ''short on action'' in protecting Americans against terrorism and added, ''As we saw again last week in Spain, real action is what we need.''   Democrats inside and outside Mr. Kerry's campaign said on Monday that the situation in Spain now was too uncertain and delicate to use politically.   The Kerry campaign said the senator had no plans to delve into Spain, even though he planned to make a big speech on national security on Wednesday.   One Democrat, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who dropped out of the presidential race last year, explained why Mr. Kerry might think it unwise to try to make political hay out of the tragedy.   ''First,'' Mr. Graham said, ''we don't know enough of what happened in Spain to develop a final conclusion.   ''Second, I don't think any American politician can run for president on a platform that they hope bad things happen to the people of America, and some might interpret an evaluation of the Spain tragedy on the campaign trail as a statement that we're next.''   Other Democratic politicians said American voters did not have to be told directly that the bombings in Spain showed that Mr. Bush had failed to stamp out terrorism.   For Mr. Kerry, said former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a friend and supporter of his onetime colleague and now president of New School University, ''there is an opportunity, but you've got to grieve the death, you've got to feel the tragedy, or there's no chance of getting public opinion on your side.''   At the White House, Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman, was asked repeatedly on Monday whether the administration thought the attacks in Spain had been intended to affect the outcome of the election there, whether the administration was concerned that the terrorists had prevailed and whether the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq would pose a problem.   Mr. McClellan dodged the questions. This was a typical answer: ''I think there's going to, obviously, be a lot of political analysis done on the election. Let me tell you what I know, and that is that terrorists are indiscriminate. They are indiscriminate in who they attack and when they attack. Terrorists have attacked civilians in Indonesia, they've attacked civilians in Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and a number of other places. Terrorists want to spread fear and chaos. They want to intimidate. That is why they attack innocent men, women and children. They have no regard for innocent life.''   But if the White House seemed defensive, Democratic politicians basically steered clear of the issue.   ''We're all sick to our stomachs that Al Qaeda seems to have scored a victory,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''After a real tragedy happens, you don't want to talk about it right away.''   Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Kerry early in the campaign before signing on with Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said, ''When an appropriate time has passed, I certainly think you can make what happened in Spain an issue.''   But now, Mr. Lehane continued, ''I think you just have to be very careful about not looking like you are trying to score political points when there are literally funerals going on.''   One of the few exceptions to the rule of silence was the response of Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who has few delegates but has not folded his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He issued a statement saying the events demonstrated that ''the invasion of Iraq has made us all less safe.''   Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said any linking of the terrorism in Spain with domestic politics would make politicians sound as if they were saying, ''I told you so.''   Leon E. Panetta, a former Democratic congressman from California who was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, said, ''The smart thing from my own experience is that when there's a highly charged emotional event in the world, you're better off letting that event play out by itself rather than engaging it politically.   ''Otherwise, you might pay a heavy price because you don't know how it's going to turn out.''

33389,"With the United States presidential election a top concern, investors are trying to make money in the stock market based on who might prevail in November. A liberal Democrat for president? Shares of stock in defense companies, or Papa John's pizza, might fall, some market researchers say. Another four years of President Trump? Consider buying Exxon. If Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Pete Buttigieg win the White House? Anybody's guess. TD The United States presidential election is still 10 months away. But players in the financial markets -- where tolerance for the unexpected tends to be low -- are already trading the politics of 2020 like a choose-your-own-mystery novel, with the ending unknown. Financial firms, keenly aware of the stark ideological differences between the top Democratic candidates and Mr. Trump, are creating ''candidate baskets,'' or bundles of investments tailored to several different outcomes in the general election. There is a ''progressive agenda'' group of stocks that analysts believe will fall if Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Bernie Sanders of Vermont wins the primary or the general election. Hedge funds are buying the equivalent of insurance policies that will pay them money if blue-chip stocks fall in the aftermath of a Warren or Sanders victory. On the flip side, some investors are buying oil exploration, defense and aerospace stocks, and banks that are expected to benefit if Mr. Trump prevails. And a stock-like instrument called the ''trade war'' fund, with exposure to companies that would be affected by the impact of new or changing tariffs, attracted substantial attention before being liquidated and converted into a private investment vehicle. ''Market participants agree that the U.S. election is the big event for 2020,'' Amelia Garnett, a salesperson in Goldman Sachs's securities division, said on a recent podcast. The financial industry views Ms. Warren in particular with apprehension, and her rise in the polls during the late summer and fall, Ms. Garnett added, inspired ''a rapid flurry of interest'' from clients to prepare for the possible impact of the type of higher-tax, bigger-government agenda Ms. Warren has promised. The goal for investors, of course, is to make money off their wagers -- or at least to avoid losing it due to some unforeseen political outcome. But some analysts say the performance of these politically oriented portfolios may also be a leading indicator of public opinion as the country braces for what's likely to be a volatile election year. ''The idea is this: we're going to end up either on the very left or the very right with this election,'' said Ben Emons, an investment strategist at Medley Global Advisors who has been fine-tuning the candidate baskets in recent months. ''The market will trade it,'' Mr. Emons added, ''because the market will price in the probabilities around these outcomes.'' Although the investment focus for progressive candidates has been on stocks to sell, analysts say there is also a reverse case involving stocks to buy. Those, according to Mr. Emons, could be in areas that Ms. Warren's policies, for example, would expand -- child-care providers like Bright Horizons Family Solutions, for instance, or green energy providers like Brookfield Renewable Partners. Although stocks to sell in a second term for President Trump have been less of an investor focus, Mr. Emons said that media stocks could fall under that category, given that news organizations are subject to frequent attacks from the president. Still, with the Iowa caucuses less than six weeks away, some market participants consider it far too early to place political bets now. Here is a look at analysis of various investments based on different election outcomes: The Trump Trade The economy has been solid this year, with unemployment at a 50-year low. As a result, the stock market has looked past potential red flags like wavering consumer confidence and manufacturing activity, and the S&P 500 had risen 29 percent as of late Thursday. Against that backdrop, many analysts believe that trading in anticipation of a second term for Mr. Trump has been simply a matter of continuing to buy shares of large companies that have fared well in recent years. ''Markets at this point kind of love gridlock in Washington,'' said Kevin Russell, the chief investment officer of UBS O'Connor, the Swiss bank's New York hedge-fund arm. Inaction in Congress, he said, means that the status quo will continue, with lower corporate tax rates and deregulation by executive order benefiting many large companies. To invest in that thesis, Mr. Russell typically encourages his clients to buy or sell specific sectors, rather than individual stocks. Mr. Emons believes that banks like JPMorgan Chase, which have benefited from Mr. Trump's pro-growth agenda and financial deregulation, are considered compelling ''Trump wins'' trades. The same goes for commodity companies like Exxon, which has benefited from his curbing of environmental protections, as well as major aerospace and defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Even the embattled Boeing -- whose chief executive was fired Monday amid a crisis over the safety of its 737 Max -- stands to benefit from Mr. Trump's policies, because of deregulation and the tariffs he has imposed on its European rival, Airbus. Mr. Emons calls Boeing a ''national champion'' for Mr. Trump. The Progressive Agenda Basket Positioning for a potential Democratic victory next November has been more complicated. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders -- whose platforms include plans for upending the current health care system, overhauling the financial system and fighting climate change -- have inspired a variety of market trades. The basic Warren or Sanders trade is a mirror image of the Trump trade: shorting, or betting against, blue-chip stocks. Several hedge-fund managers have already predicted a 25 or even 30 percent drop in the S&P if Ms. Warren were to win, for example, and the popularity of an option -- effectively an insurance policy -- on a drop in the index rose as she moved into the top tier of contenders, according to Ms. Garnett of Goldman Sachs and other strategists. To game out the potential impact of a Warren or Sanders victory, analysts at JPMorgan recently established a roster of 51 stocks. Called the Progressive Democratic Agenda Basket, it consists of companies that, for a variety of reasons, are expected to be most affected by the candidates should a progressive prevail.  Exxon, Chevron and other fossil fuel companies are on the list for negative impact, as are health-care providers like Cigna and Humana. So are banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, the private-equity firm Blackstone Group, and tech giants like Alphabet and Facebook, which Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have called for breaking up. Some of the less-obvious inclusions include the Gap and the pizza chain Papa John's International, which JPMorgan believes could face pressure on their profit margins if a progressive president pushes hikes in the national minimum wage. ''The biggest risk for 2020 is the presidential election, for which we recommend hedges,'' wrote Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a researcher in the bank's global cross-asset strategy group, and colleagues on Dec. 11. The second biggest concern, he said in an interview, is the chance of a recession. Of course, the stock market is a fickle animal, and any number of things could affect it in unexpected ways, proving the predictions wrong. The Unknowns Mr. Biden, the former vice president who has consistently led the polls among Democratic contenders, has so far stymied most of the stock-pickers. He has said he'll build upon the Affordable Care Act in order to retain a private insurance market for people who want to purchase health care on exchanges. Given that, Mr. Biden occupies a space between Mr. Trump -- who has tried to dismantle the health care law and revert to a system more dominated by private insurers -- and Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who envision a government-run single-payer system. Mr. Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who calls his middle-of-the-road approach to health care ''Medicare for All Who Want It'' and who, like Mr. Biden, has not yet fully articulated his proposed legislative agenda, is a similarly elusive investment target. ''I think the challenge with Biden and Buttigieg is that the platforms aren't really developed,'' said Mr. Russell of UBS O'Connor. Ultimately, stock investors crave nothing so much as greater certainty -- an element that may be in short supply for many months to come. ''We need to know who the Democratic candidate is,'' Ms. Garnett said, ''and the quicker we know that, the better it will be for the investing environment.''

33390,"Readers discuss the ethical and political arguments. ''Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us?'' one reader asks. To the Editor: TD Re ''Yes, He's Guilty. Impeachment Is a Mistake'' (column, Sept. 27): Like David Brooks, I thought an impeachment proceeding would be a mistake. As the process unfolds, I now realize that was all about calculation but not about our country's needs in this fraught moment in our history. Mr. Brooks says ''this will probably achieve nothing.'' If achieving nothing means removing the president from office, this is probably right. The impeachment process does, however, help Congress regain its rightful place as an equal branch of government meant to provide checks and balances on an out-of-control and corrupt executive branch. Now that's an achievement. Mr. Brooks writes that ''this process will increase public cynicism.'' What is more cynical than knowing that the president has recruited a foreign government to influence our election and doing nothing? ''This could embed Trumpism within the G.O.P.'' That ship has sailed. Who imagined a Republican Party blind to increasing debt before Mr. Trump? Since when do Republicans trample on the rights of states to set their own policies on protecting their air and water? As Nancy Pelosi said, ''He gave us no choice.'' The whistle-blower is a patriot. The Democrats' only choice was to have his back. Elliott Miller Bala Cynwyd, Pa. To the Editor: David Brooks advises that he spoke with ''hundreds of people'' in the last few days and ''only one even mentioned impeachment.'' I'm not sure whom Mr. Brooks is hanging out with, but they must be from another planet. James A. Steinberg Rhinebeck, N.Y. To the Editor: Impeach President Trump? That's just what he wants. Impeachment puts him in the narcissistic place that he wants to be: the center of attention. It draws attention away from his failures to make deals on important domestic and foreign policy issues like immigration, affordable health care, international trade and so on. The icing on the cake is that a partisan Republican Senate will not convict.  Donald Trump doesn't want to be impeached the same way that Br'er Rabbit didn't want to be thrown in the briar patch. Gary F. Marton Brooklyn To the Editor: Could it be the case that President Trump really does not understand that he did anything wrong in his conversation with the president of Ukraine? This may be just the way he's always done business, by threatening, bullying and demanding something of value in exchange for doing what he is already obligated to do. Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us? Lawrence Weisman Westport, Conn. To the Editor: In my fantasy board game ''Impeach Trump Now!'' I envision a deck of ''outrage'' cards from which players would draw. The cards would have various point values and would say things like ''Use of the presidency for personal enrichment,'' ''Chronic flagrant lying to the American public'' and ''Secret extortion of a foreign leader for political gain.'' Which card would have the highest point value? My personal pick would be ''Forced separation of children from their parents with no plan for their reunification.'' Vicki Riba Koestler Alexandria, Va.

33391,"If the election were held today, Joe Biden would crush President Trump. Almost any other Democrat -- including one named Generic Democrat -- would also beat the man who runs an administration of kooks, quacks, criminals, drunks, wife beaters and grifters. Sadly, there remains a sizable constituency for incompetency on this scale -- the look-the-other-way evangelicals, the get-yours-while-you-can corporate class, the ditch-your-principles Republican officeholders. They're with Stupid, no matter how much Trump debases the office. TD But you can't beat nothing with better-than-nothing. Not-Trump is not enough. Quick: What are Democrats for? Continuity With Change? Stronger Together? A Better Deal? Two of those are actual slogans of the national party, and one is from the feckless politician on ''Veep.'' Surprisingly, the Democrats are thinking big for once. The ideas being tossed around are risky enough to be called bold: a guaranteed-jobs program, universal health care, a public option for banking, free community college. But the best-known carriers of that message have problems. Nancy Pelosi is toxic in many a targeted red-to-blue district. Chuck Schumer sounds too much like a party hack. The presidential contenders all have weaknesses. If you were to go into a lab and create a perfect candidate for 2020, along with a popular policy prescription for this anxious decade, what would that look like? It would be a big-hearted, progressive person whose appeal crosses class lines. It would be someone very much like Biden -- a younger Biden. Let's ignore the age issue for now. Your candidate would need to be ethically clean -- no Wall Street speeches, no foundations that serve as backdoor ways to do well while doing good, no sexual misconduct. This is vital, because Trump has filled the swamp with odious creatures, taking their cues from him. People were sick of it in 2006 -- when Democrats won the House in part on campaigning against the ''culture of corruption.'' They were sick of it in 2016, when Hillary Clinton could not shake the stink of big finance-connected profiteering. And they are sick of it today, when more than half of Trump's cabinet has engaged in questionable behavior. It might help if your candidate was not from the political class. Oprah? She's not interested, so she says. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook showed some promise until we all realized that social media had been weaponized to destroy democracy. The entrepreneur Mark Cuban? Haven't we had enough of a reality show star playing at being president? This gets you to the bench of elected officials. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, is a whirlwind of Big Ideas of late. She just unveiled a financial first step for paycheck-to-paycheck Americans: a plan to require every post office to offer basic banking services -- an alternative to predatory payday loans. She is coldbloodedly #MeToo, having shoved her former colleague Al Franken and the Clintons under the bus. And she has gotten ahead of the one-note socialist Senator Bernie Sanders on the idea of a job guarantee for everyone who wants to work. The problem there is cost (up to a half-trillion dollars, by some estimates) and the bureaucratic nightmare it could create. Gillibrand is swinging for the fences, even if she did the least well of major Democrats against Trump in recent polling. Much of the party's energy is coming from the Sanders wing; Sanders himself will be 79 on Election Day 2020 and he is not getting any less cranky. But don't overlook the enthusiasm generated by the Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke or Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana. They've stood up for the basic right of health care, and against the wrong of more tax cuts for the rich -- foundational positions favored by a majority of the country. Another prospect is the Senate's resident vegan, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He's got some Wall Street problems and is less populist than the mood of the country. But he has terrific political skills; he wouldn't need a slogan like Stronger Together. In the same class is the rookie Senator Kamala Harris of California. She's sharp, dynamic, with the right balance of ego and intellect. But how would a California liberal play in Scranton, Pa.? That brings us back to Scranton-born Biden. A new study suggests that fear of cultural displacement was a greater driver for Trump voters than economic anxiety -- identity politics for aging white males. It would seem to take some of the working-class-savior reasoning out of Uncle Joe's candidacy. But that analysis still doesn't adequately explain the millions of people who voted for both Barack Obama and Trump. That's where Biden comes in, and why he cleans up against Trump in early matchups. The problem is that he will be 77 on Election Day. Trump will be 74. He's old and he's angry, and will get only older and angrier. Build a better Biden, from our political lab, and you win.

33392,"They've become unrevealing quip contests. Nervous managers of the scheduled 2020 presidential debates are shuffling the logistics and locations to deal with the threat of the coronavirus. But here's a better idea: Scrap them altogether. And not for health reasons. TD The debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership. In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure, likability. It should also go without saying, dignity. Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily on the verdict than their true value deserves. Perhaps the most substantive televised debate of all was the first one, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, which Nixon was considered to have won on substance on the radio, while the cooler and more appealing Kennedy won on television. Since these weren't true debates, the concept of ''winning'' one of these odd encounters was always amorphous. (To be sure, many questions by panels of journalists were designed less to stimulate debate than to challenge one of the candidates.) Over time, the debates came to resemble professional wrestling matches, and more substantive debates were widely panned in the press. Points went to snappy comebacks and one-liners. Witty remarks drew laughs from the audience and got repeated for days and remembered for years. Some of them have been less than hilarious, but they did the job of dominating reaction to a debate. Whatever substance existed was largely ignored. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan debated the incumbent Jimmy Carter, Carter made a serious point about Reagan's position on Medicare, and Reagan's riposte, ''There you go again,'' a non-answer if ever there was one, brought down the house and that was that. In the first 1984 debate, Reagan, seeking re-election and at 73, the oldest person to be nominated for the presidency, seemed tired and tended to wander off mentally at times. His lackluster performance caused panic among his staff. Democratic supporters of former Vice President Walter Mondale saw an opening. But another debate soon followed. Thoroughly prepared, Reagan got off the crack, ''I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.'' The audience roared and Mr. Mondale feigned a laugh, knowing he was cooked. Not even Reagan's ending of that debate, reminiscing about driving along the Pacific Coast and musing about time capsules, was enough to undermine his political prospects. Reagan's ''joke'' aimed at nullifying the age issue dominated the post-debate chatter. But what is the point or relevance of the carefully prepared one-liner? It's as spontaneous as a can of sardines. It's usually delivered from a memory chip in the mind, having been fashioned and rehearsed with aides. When is a president called upon to put down an interlocutor, be it a member of Congress or a foreign leader? This, by the way, isn't written out of any concern that Donald Trump will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine in a long string of such contests. The point is that ''winning'' a debate, however assessed, should be irrelevant, as are the debates themselves. The better way to pay attention to and choose among the presidential candidates is to follow the long campaign that so many complain about. The reason for such moaning has always been a mystery, because unless the campaign is taking place in your living room, you can simply switch it off. The key words are ''pay attention to,'' because over the stretch of 2015-2016 it wasn't impossible to see the implications of a Trump presidency. Not just the vulgarity but the ignorance and insensitivity and extreme narcissism were apparent more than a year before Election Day. Moreover, we didn't need the debates to tell us that Trump had chosen to be the P.T. Barnum of American politics. For him, it was (and still is) all about the show, about distracting the public from reality. It was obvious that Mr. Trump had no real affinity for the working-class people whose votes he was chasing. Nothing in his life suggested that his heart was with struggling workers and farmers. It wasn't impossible to know that he wasn't the skilled businessman he professed to be. His bankruptcies and shady business practices and discrimination against Black tenants were no secret. The debates took us nowhere nearer the realities about arguably the most disastrous president in our history. They became simply another tool in his arsenal. The party conventions, also vestigial organs of a political system that no longer exists, are close to being done away with, if not for the reasons they should be. There's no reason not to throw the presidential debates on the trash heap of useless (at best) rituals that are no help in our making such a fateful decision.

33393,"Whether or not they liked the result of the presidential election, many publishers were pleased this week to see that the country remained as divided as ever.   Partisan wrangling, after all, sent liberals and conservatives to bookstores in droves over the last year, seeking out volumes that largely confirmed their views of the other side. From ''Unfit for Command,'' the antipathetic account of Senator John Kerry's service in Vietnam, to ''Against All Enemies,'' an insider's critical look at the Bush administration's buildup to war in Iraq, partisan political books led the best-seller lists for much of the year.   TD Books bashing Mr. Kerry are likely to disappear now, and those attacking President Bush might similarly fade away, at least for a while, as Democrats regroup. But publishing executives say they expect that books emphasizing the differences between Republicans and Democrats will remain popular for a long time.   ''Good or bad, the split in America right now creates a publishing opportunity on both sides of the fence,'' Jack Romanos, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster, said. ''To publish for the middle of the road right now would be suicide.''   In the short term, Democrats are likely to search for explanations of what went wrong in the election, and the probability is high that at least one or two Kerry campaign officials will offer an insider's view of the campaign. Bush administration officials who do not return for a second term could set off aggressive bidding wars for the right to publish their memoirs. The most coveted of those prizes would probably be Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who has not said whether he will depart.   Already, a book by George J. Tenet, former director of central intelligence, has been shopped around by Robert B. Barnett, the Washington lawyer who negotiated the publishing deal for former President Bill Clinton. Twelve publishers are expected to bid on the Tenet book beginning next week, and executives said Mr. Tenet could receive an advance of several million dollars for a book to be published in late 2005 or 2006.   In the longer term, Republicans are likely to try to promote some forward-looking books, as factions of the party vie for control of the agenda. Marji Ross, president and publisher of Regnery Publishing, is planning to put a big effort behind ''Winning the Future,'' by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, which will lay out ''a new Contract With America,'' Ms. Ross said. In January, Regnery will publish ''Men in Black'' by Mark Levin, an assessment of judicial activism and its effect on the courts.   Ms. Ross said that old-fashioned attack books would not disappear, however. ''Any book needs to have a sense of vitality and energy,'' she said. ''We don't want to be publishing boring policy books. We want people to feel their blood pressure rise when they read our books.''   Brad Miner, executive editor of American Compass, a conservative book club that is part of Bookspan, the company that includes the Book-of-the-Month Club, said he sent an e-mail message to several publishers on Wednesday recommending that they consider books that delve into ''moral issues.'' According to polls, a plurality of voters said Tuesday that those issues had the biggest effect on their choice for president.   Even with Mr. Bush having won a majority of the votes, however, conservatives are unlikely to think they are controlling the agenda, Mr. Miner said. ''Most conservatives still will feel that the momentum of the culture is against them,'' he said. That is likely to mean continued demand for authors like Ann Coulter and others who seem easily to engender outrage at perceptions of liberal excess.   Liberals, meanwhile, are likely to try to figure out what happened. Already, three books that seek to explain how conservatives have secured so much real estate on the electoral map have surged in sales.   ''What's the Matter With Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,'' by Thomas Frank, ranked as high as No. 2 on the Amazon.com best-seller list in the days after the election. The book, published in June by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company, takes a polemical look at what Mr. Frank calls the Great Backlash, the popular revolt against what conservatives see as a liberal establishment.   Also shooting up the best-seller lists was ''Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,'' by George Lakoff, a linguist who argues that Republicans have succeeded in part by controlling the language of the debate on social issues in a way that portrays their views most favorably. The book was published in mid-September by Chelsea Green Publishing.   And gaining renewed attention was ''The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,'' published in May by Penguin Press. The book, by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, United States-based journalists for The Economist magazine, analyzes the history and sociology of the conservative movement.   John Sterling, the president and publisher of Henry Holt, said the company made plans several weeks ago to have Mr. Frank of ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' available for interviews if the Democrats lost, a factor he cited for at least some of the book's renewed popularity. Mr. Sterling also made sure there were plenty of books on hand. After shipping more than 100,000 since publication in June, Mr. Sterling said he expected 15,000 more to go out the door in the week after the election.

33405,"HOLLAND, Pa. -- The Tea Party movement ignited a year ago, fueled by anti-establishment anger. Now, Tea Party activists are trying to take over the establishment, ground up. Across the country, they are signing up to be Republican precinct leaders, a position so low-level that it often remains vacant, but which comes with the ability to vote for the party executives who endorse candidates, approve platforms and decide where the party spends money. TD A new group called the National Precinct Alliance says it has a coordinator in nearly every state to recruit Tea Party activists to fill the positions and has already swelled the number of like-minded members in Republican Party committees in Arizona and Nevada. Its mantra is this: take the precinct, take the state, take the party -- and force it to nominate conservatives rather than people they see as liberals in Republican clothing. Here, in a perennial battleground district outside Philadelphia, Tea Party activists are trying to strip the local committee of its influence in choosing the Republican nominee to run against Representative Patrick J. Murphy, a Democrat who won the seat in 2006 by about 1,500 votes. After the local party said it would stick to its custom of endorsing a candidate rather than holding an open primary, Tea Party groups decided to hold their own candidate forum where people could cast a ballot. If the party does not yield, the groups say they will host a debate, too. ''We kind of changed the rules,'' said Anastasia Przybylski, one of the organizers. The Tea Party movement, named the original tax revolt in 1773, might be better described as a diverse, rambunctious and Internet-connected network of groups, powered by grass-roots anxiety about the economy, bailouts and increasing government involvement in health care. At one extreme are militia members who have shown up at meetings wearing guns and suggesting that institutions like the Federal Reserve be eliminated. At the other are those like Ms. Przybylski, who describes herself as ''just a stay-at-home mom'' who became agitated about the federal stimulus package. And if the Democrats are big-government socialists, the Republicans, in the Tea Party mind, are enablers. In some recent polls, a hypothetical Tea Party wins more support than Democrats or Republicans, and the most anti-establishment Tea Party activists push to fight as a third party. But as the movement looks toward the midterm elections in November, a growing number of activists argue that the best way to translate anger into influence is to infiltrate the Republican establishment (Democrats being, for the average Tea Partier, beyond redemption). ''If you want to have revenge against the Republican Party for using you for so many years, the best way is to turn around and use the Republican Party to your advantage,'' said Eric Odom, a Tea Party activist in Chicago who recently started a political action committee, and on his blog urged Tea Partiers to stop complaining about the Republican Party and ''move in and take it over.'' Republican leaders have been trying to harness the Tea Party energy -- Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, recently called the Tea Parties ''a revelatory moment.'' ''It puts in stark relief where the American people are, how they feel and what they feel,'' Mr. Steele said. ''It's important for our party to appreciate and understand that so we can move toward it, and embrace it.'' Not all Republicans agree. Some say the party needs to broaden its reach, not cater to the fringe. The defining experience for many Tea Party groups was the special election in the 23rd Congressional District of New York in November, where party leaders chose a candidate whom conservatives viewed as a Republican in name only -- she supported same-sex marriage, abortion rights and the federal stimulus package. After activists flooded the district to support a conservative third-party candidate, the Republican dropped out and endorsed the Democrat, who won. Conservatives took the Republican retreat as a victory, but also saw the power of the party structure in deciding who the candidates will be. The rallying cry for more local involvement has been ''No more NY-23's.'' ''We don't want to see what happened in New York happen here,'' Ms. Przybylski said. The forum here drew nine candidates and a standing-room crowd in an auditorium built for 1,200. The questions organizers had drawn up for the candidates hinted at the issues important to so called Teapublicans. Will you pledge to vote against tax increases, even hidden taxes like those in health care reform? Should corporate executives who encourage illegal immigrants to stay because it is good for business be hauled off to jail? Do you believe manmade pollution is a significant contributor to global warming? (''I don't necessarily think there's been global warming,'' one candidate objected.) Each was asked to define the 10th Amendment, and to cite examples of where it ''might have been violated.'' ''It's my favorite amendment in the Constitution,'' exclaimed one candidate, Ira Hoffman. ''I can't believe it!'' The amendment declares that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people, and Tea Party activists hold that Congress has overstepped its bounds, particularly by legislating health care. So candidates were asked whether they would support efforts to nullify the health care bill? Finally, the moderator asked them if 2010 would be ''the year of the Tea Party.'' The candidates, and many in the audience, said it would, but only if the Tea Party advocates worked the system. ''I think we can do greater things working in a system that's established than we ever can being a bunch of anarchists,'' said Jennifer Turner Stefano, a vice president of a local Tea Party group who is contesting her local Republican committeeperson. Ms. Stefano, a stay-at-home mother and former television reporter, will have to get 10 signatures and put her name on the ballot to run. But the National Precinct Alliance estimates that about 60 percent of the roughly 150,000 local Republican committee seats are vacant and can be filled by essentially showing up. ''Even if you've got a slight majority, you just need maybe 26 states, then you can have your say in how the party goes,'' said Philip Glass, a former commercial mortgage banker in Cincinnati who is the national director of the precinct alliance. The precinct strategy, like the Tea Party movement itself, has spread via the Internet, on sites like Resistnet.com. A National Tea Party Convention in Nashville next month will feature seminars on how to take over starting at the precinct level. Advocates hold up the example of Las Vegas, where a group of about 30 people who had become friendly at Tea Party events last spring met to discuss how they could turn their crowds into political influence. One mentioned that there were about 500 open precinct committee positions in the local Republican Party. They recruited other activists and flooded the committee -- the Republican Party says it now has 780 committee people, up from about 300. In July, they approved a new executive committee, and Tony Warren, one of the organizers and a new precinct committeeman himself, said six out of seven executives are ''constitutional conservatives,'' in keeping with Tea Party ideology. With the bulk of Nevada's population in the Las Vegas area, the local committee was able to elect a conservative slate to the state party in December, including a state chairman who has said he wants to make the party ''safe'' for conservatives. As recently as last spring, Mr. Warren said, ''we didn't even know how the darn party worked.'' PHOTOS: The audience, top, at a forum held by Tea Party groups in Holland, Pa.

33406,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 -- President Bush delivered two competing messages to Americans today as he encouraged them to go to ballgames and get on airplanes but at the same time declared that the country was at risk.   ''Our nation is still in danger,'' Mr. Bush said at a White House reception as he announced a fourth case of anthrax, this one in New York City. ''But the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''  TD  Seconds later, Mr. Bush exhorted Americans to go about their lives.   ''We cannot let the terrorists lock our country down,'' he said. ''We can't let terrorists, a few evildoers, hold us hostage.'' Americans, he said, need to fight terrorism ''by going to work, going to ballgames, getting on airplanes, singing with joy and strength.''   The dueling messages of reassurance and warning echoed the themes of the president's prime-time news conference on Thursday night and presented a growing challenge, Republicans say, for Mr. Bush not to confuse or frighten Americans. But the consensus among the professionals who help fashion presidential images is that Mr. Bush is on track, for now. His message, they say, is simple: Go out, but be careful. America has changed.   ''I think that's the reality, and I think we're going to be bounced back and forth and up and down for a long time to come,'' said Michael K. Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image consultant who has advised the current White House. ''I think he's done a pretty good job of trying to balance that role of counselor or calmer along with his role as commander in chief.''   Mr. Deaver added: ''Everything I've seen, just in my own experience, tells me that people are hanging on to the government for the first time in a long time. This is when Washington is important. I hope he understands that we need constant reassurance. It's topic A, and it really is based on fear. I think he senses that, and so he is out there much more than normal.''   So far Mr. Bush has not crystallized his message of reassurance and warning into a succinct sound bite, but has veered back and forth, depending on the day or event. Two weeks ago in Chicago, when he announced new security measures at the nation's airports, Mr. Bush seemed to become the national travel director, urging Americans to fly again.   But in announcing the new case of anthrax today with jarring words in the middle of an East Room celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month that included the singer Gloria Estefan,  Mr. Bush was once again the bearer of alarming news.   The case of anthrax, he said, ''has got to cause concern for our nation.'' Mr. Bush then reported that the victim was ''doing well'' and that she ''obviously didn't ingest enough to cause death, thank God.'' He also said that ''I want everybody in the country to know we're responding rapidly'' and added that ''the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster, said that so far Americans seemed to understand the simultaneous warnings of danger and cheerful proddings to live again. ''I think people recognize that both of these things are true,'' he said. ''We haven't had foreigners killing Americans here since I guess the War of 1812, and we've always had this notion that these two big oceans have kept us protected. Over the longer term we are now going to have to live with this risk, and at the same time not let it change us.''   Mr. Teeter cited bombings in London and terrorism in other countries in Europe as a model, however distressing, for how Americans can adjust to an undercurrent of fear in their lives.   ''It's clear that democracies and relatively open societies can learn to live with it,'' Mr. Teeter said. ''But I think it will be an adjustment and change for this country.''   Mr. Bush and the White House have sought to harness some of that fear by asking each child in America to donate a dollar to Afghan children. Today Mr. Bush said the inspiration for his campaign came from the March of Dimes, which began nearly 64 years ago based on another fear, polio. Over four months in 1938, he said, Americans sent 2.6 million dimes to the White House of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who himself had the disease.   ''Late in life, Eleanor Roosevelt asked what her husband had learned from the experience of polio,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech today to a March of Dimes conference at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ''She said that Franklin had gained strength and courage he had not before.''   Noting that a dollar today is roughly equivalent to a dime in the late 1930's, Mr. Bush, at that moment the reassurer, concluded: ''We all need to have a bit of Franklin Roosevelt in us today.''

33407,"AS oil and gasoline prices rise, political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve is building, including among some in Congress. The global oil market is fundamentally strained and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems. Yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses. Instead it should be preserved to address an emergency disruption in supply. TD While no one can confidently predict the global oil market, arguments that prices will remain high throughout the year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative. Global supplies are tight, and the hope for an improving global economy will only increase demand. Historically, Saudi Arabia has maintained a cushion of spare production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply. This spare capacity has played a critical role in calming the market when instability threatens oil-producing nations. That spare capacity is now likely to be only 3 percent, which will make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to increase production on short notice. The past year of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has not resulted in any major supply disruptions, but roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in Sudan, Yemen and Syria, and the growing impact of United States and European sanctions on Iranian production. If successful, President Obama's recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on Iran and strain global oil markets further. Indeed, increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is good news in the effort to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capability. Iran's total production is now about 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 2 million barrels per day are exported. The United States Energy Information Administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this summer could cut demand for Iranian oil exports in half. This combination of circumstances, however, does not yet constitute a severe supply disruption. Using the reserve now would be premature, reduce our national security options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets. Since its inception in 1975, the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances. There have been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions, including test sales, exchanges to address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise $220 million to balance the federal budget. The oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions -- during the first Iraq war, after Hurricane Katrina, and last year, when President Obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil during that country's civil war. In each instance, the releases were coordinated internationally, through the International Energy Agency, with some oil offered by the European Union, the United States and other non-OPEC nations. Each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances. While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances, the president and Congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of $100-a-barrel oil and $4-a-gallon gasoline. Despite the traditional election-year rancor, there is actually considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done. Increasing domestic oil production is extremely important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit. The United States is the third largest oil producer in the world and United States production must continue to play a critical role in meeting global demand. That production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by 2020. If this increase is achieved, the American contribution to the global market will push down global prices and could enable some increase in global spare capacity. The Obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production. However, no amount of production can insulate the United States from the global market and global price spikes. The ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use compared to the size of our economy. In 1975, our economy used 1.2 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of gross domestic product (2005 dollars); in 2010, we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of G.D.P. This reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel economy. A diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of Congress. While it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades, there is considerable support in both parties for efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels, electric and natural gas vehicles. All of these actions will continue to increase the oil-efficiency and resiliency of the United States economy. For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets. RF",[],perso
33408,"Caucusgoers, uniquely, will declare their loyalty before their friends and neighbors. And they are taking their responsibility very seriously. CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- It is a public display of civic duty unique in American politics: Iowans on Monday night will stand in front of their neighbors and express their preference for a candidate for president. No curtains covering a voting machine. No private paper ballots. Just a declaration of loyalty before fellow Democrats. TD The Iowa caucuses are at once both quaint and globally significant, with a singular power to elevate, or deflate, candidacies. But for all of their idiosyncrasies, perhaps their most distinctive element is the sheer transparency they provide to the selection process. At a time of such political polarization, underpinned by anxiety among Iowa Democrats that they will elevate a nominee unable to defeat President Trump, the public nature of the caucuses has amplified the stakes. In interviews with scores of Iowans over the last three months, many expressed ambivalence about making a choice, desperately trying to assess what kind of candidate others might want to elect. Many appeared wary of picking sides, and risking fragmentation, at the expense of presenting a united front; they vowed to support the eventual nominee no matter what. Some caucusgoers said, tellingly, that they were eager to knock doors for candidates they supported but preferred to do so in nearby towns or counties lest they alienate their neighbors. ''The idea is that the caucuses are this very romantic Jeffersonian thing, with neighbors gathering in small groups to discuss ideas and candidates, and help choose leadership that will organize volunteers and lead us to electoral victory,'' said Nathan Thompson, the Democratic chairman in Winneshiek County. ''Well, in reality, it can be a very frustrating and divisive thing for all of these volunteers and attendees.'' It is another complicating factor in a race full of them. Even elected officials are trying to divine the best approach. Rob Sand, the state auditor and a rising star in the Democratic Party, said he planned to caucus for ''uncommitted,'' a category for those who do not want to align themselves with a candidate. Or he may not caucus at all. ''Ultimately, many of us will have a nominee who was not our first choice -- we are going to have to put that aside and do our duty to help that nominee win,'' Mr. Sand said. ''So, I'm planning to set aside my own ability to make a choice to be a voice for unity.'' As the caucuses loom, Iowa Democrats are preparing to make what may be their most significant decision ever, one that could set the party on a path to ousting Mr. Trump from the White House or divide it further. And rarely has the outcome of the caucuses been so difficult to predict or so highly anticipated. ''Anything can happen here,'' said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. ''There's growing clarity -- but there's not a lot of clarity.'' Adding to the sense of uncertainty, both the progressive and moderate wings of the party have taken turns asserting their dominance. All four of the leading candidates -- Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., -- have led polls here in recent months. Another challenger, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has edged closer but not yet close enough. Most recently, Mr. Sanders has appeared to open up a lead in Iowa, consolidating liberal backing as more moderate candidates in the race continue to split their support. A nascent attempt by moderate Democrats at thwarting his rise before it is too late has shown signs of backfiring. Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $1 million off a negative ad last week that targeted him by name. Iowa is already on tenterhooks. For months, it has defended itself against criticism that it is too white, its caucuses too exclusionary, to have the privilege of being the first state in the nominating process. Candidates have questioned the state's leadoff position in the calendar. Across the state, Iowans are wary that the absence of a clean victory could muddle the choice for Democrats in other states and undermine Iowa's claim to serving as a springboard to the nomination. ''I do think the Iowa caucuses might come to an end, especially if the results are indecisive,'' said John Grennan, the Democratic chairman in Poweshiek County. ''2016 was very messy. 2020 could be, too.'' Yet the race's prevailing uncertainty has not stopped strategists, campaign aides and caucusgoers from prognosticating that has grown more frenetic as the Iowa contest approaches. It is a parlor game that has been rendered even more difficult by a complex new set of caucus rules. For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will report, on a rolling basis, three numbers on caucus night -- a delegate count and the amount of support on both the first and second rounds, known as alignments -- leaving open the possibility that more than one candidate could claim victory. What if Mr. Sanders receives the most support on the first alignment but another candidate wins on the delegate count? What if the top candidates are clustered together, separated by only a few percentage points? Such inconclusive results would make it difficult for any candidate to ride unrivaled momentum into New Hampshire one week later. And should voters remain as undecided in New Hampshire as in Iowa, Democrats could be staring at an extended primary fight that could leave everyone bruised. For Democrats hoping for a clearer picture after Monday's caucuses, it could lead to more hand-wringing and division. Candidates have already begun attacking their rivals in a bid for dominance. Some campaigns have provided clues as to how they will assess the results on caucus night. Senior advisers to Mr. Sanders have indicated the Sanders campaign will declare victory if Mr. Sanders gets the most support on the first alignment. Aides to Mr. Buttigieg, on the other hand, are focusing on the delegate count. The Iowa Democratic Party and other party officials have encouraged the news media to report the delegate count, as has traditionally been done. With so many undecided caucusgoers, the results could come down to how well organized campaigns are, particularly at the precinct level, where the final persuading will take place. Some campaigns have put in place precinct teams to persuade and wrangle caucusgoers before and after the first alignment. Precinct captains will be in touch constantly with their campaign headquarters for directives on their strategy inside the room. Among caucusgoers, the persistent discussion of statewide political angst has only produced more angst. The degree of uncertainty, lingering even at this final stage of the precaucus season, has confounded some Democratic officials. ''Most people are undecided, and not only are they undecided but they're considering staying undecided on caucus night,'' said Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats. ''Considering the sheer number of candidates and length of the campaign season, I didn't think we would be in this position so close.''

33430,"With the United States presidential election a top concern, investors are trying to make money in the stock market based on who might prevail in November. A liberal Democrat for president? Shares of stock in defense companies, or Papa John's pizza, might fall, some market researchers say. Another four years of President Trump? Consider buying Exxon. If Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Pete Buttigieg win the White House? Anybody's guess. TD The United States presidential election is still 10 months away. But players in the financial markets -- where tolerance for the unexpected tends to be low -- are already trading the politics of 2020 like a choose-your-own-mystery novel, with the ending unknown. Financial firms, keenly aware of the stark ideological differences between the top Democratic candidates and Mr. Trump, are creating ''candidate baskets,'' or bundles of investments tailored to several different outcomes in the general election. There is a ''progressive agenda'' group of stocks that analysts believe will fall if Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Bernie Sanders of Vermont wins the primary or the general election. Hedge funds are buying the equivalent of insurance policies that will pay them money if blue-chip stocks fall in the aftermath of a Warren or Sanders victory. On the flip side, some investors are buying oil exploration, defense and aerospace stocks, and banks that are expected to benefit if Mr. Trump prevails. And a stock-like instrument called the ''trade war'' fund, with exposure to companies that would be affected by the impact of new or changing tariffs, attracted substantial attention before being liquidated and converted into a private investment vehicle. ''Market participants agree that the U.S. election is the big event for 2020,'' Amelia Garnett, a salesperson in Goldman Sachs's securities division, said on a recent podcast. The financial industry views Ms. Warren in particular with apprehension, and her rise in the polls during the late summer and fall, Ms. Garnett added, inspired ''a rapid flurry of interest'' from clients to prepare for the possible impact of the type of higher-tax, bigger-government agenda Ms. Warren has promised. The goal for investors, of course, is to make money off their wagers -- or at least to avoid losing it due to some unforeseen political outcome. But some analysts say the performance of these politically oriented portfolios may also be a leading indicator of public opinion as the country braces for what's likely to be a volatile election year. ''The idea is this: we're going to end up either on the very left or the very right with this election,'' said Ben Emons, an investment strategist at Medley Global Advisors who has been fine-tuning the candidate baskets in recent months. ''The market will trade it,'' Mr. Emons added, ''because the market will price in the probabilities around these outcomes.'' Although the investment focus for progressive candidates has been on stocks to sell, analysts say there is also a reverse case involving stocks to buy. Those, according to Mr. Emons, could be in areas that Ms. Warren's policies, for example, would expand -- child-care providers like Bright Horizons Family Solutions, for instance, or green energy providers like Brookfield Renewable Partners. Although stocks to sell in a second term for President Trump have been less of an investor focus, Mr. Emons said that media stocks could fall under that category, given that news organizations are subject to frequent attacks from the president. Still, with the Iowa caucuses less than six weeks away, some market participants consider it far too early to place political bets now. Here is a look at analysis of various investments based on different election outcomes: The Trump Trade The economy has been solid this year, with unemployment at a 50-year low. As a result, the stock market has looked past potential red flags like wavering consumer confidence and manufacturing activity, and the S&P 500 had risen 29 percent as of late Thursday. Against that backdrop, many analysts believe that trading in anticipation of a second term for Mr. Trump has been simply a matter of continuing to buy shares of large companies that have fared well in recent years. ''Markets at this point kind of love gridlock in Washington,'' said Kevin Russell, the chief investment officer of UBS O'Connor, the Swiss bank's New York hedge-fund arm. Inaction in Congress, he said, means that the status quo will continue, with lower corporate tax rates and deregulation by executive order benefiting many large companies. To invest in that thesis, Mr. Russell typically encourages his clients to buy or sell specific sectors, rather than individual stocks. Mr. Emons believes that banks like JPMorgan Chase, which have benefited from Mr. Trump's pro-growth agenda and financial deregulation, are considered compelling ''Trump wins'' trades. The same goes for commodity companies like Exxon, which has benefited from his curbing of environmental protections, as well as major aerospace and defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Even the embattled Boeing -- whose chief executive was fired Monday amid a crisis over the safety of its 737 Max -- stands to benefit from Mr. Trump's policies, because of deregulation and the tariffs he has imposed on its European rival, Airbus. Mr. Emons calls Boeing a ''national champion'' for Mr. Trump. The Progressive Agenda Basket Positioning for a potential Democratic victory next November has been more complicated. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders -- whose platforms include plans for upending the current health care system, overhauling the financial system and fighting climate change -- have inspired a variety of market trades. The basic Warren or Sanders trade is a mirror image of the Trump trade: shorting, or betting against, blue-chip stocks. Several hedge-fund managers have already predicted a 25 or even 30 percent drop in the S&P if Ms. Warren were to win, for example, and the popularity of an option -- effectively an insurance policy -- on a drop in the index rose as she moved into the top tier of contenders, according to Ms. Garnett of Goldman Sachs and other strategists. To game out the potential impact of a Warren or Sanders victory, analysts at JPMorgan recently established a roster of 51 stocks. Called the Progressive Democratic Agenda Basket, it consists of companies that, for a variety of reasons, are expected to be most affected by the candidates should a progressive prevail.  Exxon, Chevron and other fossil fuel companies are on the list for negative impact, as are health-care providers like Cigna and Humana. So are banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, the private-equity firm Blackstone Group, and tech giants like Alphabet and Facebook, which Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have called for breaking up. Some of the less-obvious inclusions include the Gap and the pizza chain Papa John's International, which JPMorgan believes could face pressure on their profit margins if a progressive president pushes hikes in the national minimum wage. ''The biggest risk for 2020 is the presidential election, for which we recommend hedges,'' wrote Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a researcher in the bank's global cross-asset strategy group, and colleagues on Dec. 11. The second biggest concern, he said in an interview, is the chance of a recession. Of course, the stock market is a fickle animal, and any number of things could affect it in unexpected ways, proving the predictions wrong. The Unknowns Mr. Biden, the former vice president who has consistently led the polls among Democratic contenders, has so far stymied most of the stock-pickers. He has said he'll build upon the Affordable Care Act in order to retain a private insurance market for people who want to purchase health care on exchanges. Given that, Mr. Biden occupies a space between Mr. Trump -- who has tried to dismantle the health care law and revert to a system more dominated by private insurers -- and Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who envision a government-run single-payer system. Mr. Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who calls his middle-of-the-road approach to health care ''Medicare for All Who Want It'' and who, like Mr. Biden, has not yet fully articulated his proposed legislative agenda, is a similarly elusive investment target. ''I think the challenge with Biden and Buttigieg is that the platforms aren't really developed,'' said Mr. Russell of UBS O'Connor. Ultimately, stock investors crave nothing so much as greater certainty -- an element that may be in short supply for many months to come. ''We need to know who the Democratic candidate is,'' Ms. Garnett said, ''and the quicker we know that, the better it will be for the investing environment.''

33431,"Readers discuss the ethical and political arguments. ''Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us?'' one reader asks. To the Editor: TD Re ''Yes, He's Guilty. Impeachment Is a Mistake'' (column, Sept. 27): Like David Brooks, I thought an impeachment proceeding would be a mistake. As the process unfolds, I now realize that was all about calculation but not about our country's needs in this fraught moment in our history. Mr. Brooks says ''this will probably achieve nothing.'' If achieving nothing means removing the president from office, this is probably right. The impeachment process does, however, help Congress regain its rightful place as an equal branch of government meant to provide checks and balances on an out-of-control and corrupt executive branch. Now that's an achievement. Mr. Brooks writes that ''this process will increase public cynicism.'' What is more cynical than knowing that the president has recruited a foreign government to influence our election and doing nothing? ''This could embed Trumpism within the G.O.P.'' That ship has sailed. Who imagined a Republican Party blind to increasing debt before Mr. Trump? Since when do Republicans trample on the rights of states to set their own policies on protecting their air and water? As Nancy Pelosi said, ''He gave us no choice.'' The whistle-blower is a patriot. The Democrats' only choice was to have his back. Elliott Miller Bala Cynwyd, Pa. To the Editor: David Brooks advises that he spoke with ''hundreds of people'' in the last few days and ''only one even mentioned impeachment.'' I'm not sure whom Mr. Brooks is hanging out with, but they must be from another planet. James A. Steinberg Rhinebeck, N.Y. To the Editor: Impeach President Trump? That's just what he wants. Impeachment puts him in the narcissistic place that he wants to be: the center of attention. It draws attention away from his failures to make deals on important domestic and foreign policy issues like immigration, affordable health care, international trade and so on. The icing on the cake is that a partisan Republican Senate will not convict.  Donald Trump doesn't want to be impeached the same way that Br'er Rabbit didn't want to be thrown in the briar patch. Gary F. Marton Brooklyn To the Editor: Could it be the case that President Trump really does not understand that he did anything wrong in his conversation with the president of Ukraine? This may be just the way he's always done business, by threatening, bullying and demanding something of value in exchange for doing what he is already obligated to do. Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us? Lawrence Weisman Westport, Conn. To the Editor: In my fantasy board game ''Impeach Trump Now!'' I envision a deck of ''outrage'' cards from which players would draw. The cards would have various point values and would say things like ''Use of the presidency for personal enrichment,'' ''Chronic flagrant lying to the American public'' and ''Secret extortion of a foreign leader for political gain.''

33432,"If the election were held today, Joe Biden would crush President Trump. Almost any other Democrat -- including one named Generic Democrat -- would also beat the man who runs an administration of kooks, quacks, criminals, drunks, wife beaters and grifters. Sadly, there remains a sizable constituency for incompetency on this scale -- the look-the-other-way evangelicals, the get-yours-while-you-can corporate class, the ditch-your-principles Republican officeholders. They're with Stupid, no matter how much Trump debases the office. TD But you can't beat nothing with better-than-nothing. Not-Trump is not enough. Quick: What are Democrats for? Continuity With Change? Stronger Together? A Better Deal? Two of those are actual slogans of the national party, and one is from the feckless politician on ''Veep.'' Surprisingly, the Democrats are thinking big for once. The ideas being tossed around are risky enough to be called bold: a guaranteed-jobs program, universal health care, a public option for banking, free community college. But the best-known carriers of that message have problems. Nancy Pelosi is toxic in many a targeted red-to-blue district. Chuck Schumer sounds too much like a party hack. The presidential contenders all have weaknesses. If you were to go into a lab and create a perfect candidate for 2020, along with a popular policy prescription for this anxious decade, what would that look like? It would be a big-hearted, progressive person whose appeal crosses class lines. It would be someone very much like Biden -- a younger Biden. Let's ignore the age issue for now. Your candidate would need to be ethically clean -- no Wall Street speeches, no foundations that serve as backdoor ways to do well while doing good, no sexual misconduct. This is vital, because Trump has filled the swamp with odious creatures, taking their cues from him. People were sick of it in 2006 -- when Democrats won the House in part on campaigning against the ''culture of corruption.'' They were sick of it in 2016, when Hillary Clinton could not shake the stink of big finance-connected profiteering. And they are sick of it today, when more than half of Trump's cabinet has engaged in questionable behavior. It might help if your candidate was not from the political class. Oprah? She's not interested, so she says. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook showed some promise until we all realized that social media had been weaponized to destroy democracy. The entrepreneur Mark Cuban? Haven't we had enough of a reality show star playing at being president? This gets you to the bench of elected officials. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, is a whirlwind of Big Ideas of late. She just unveiled a financial first step for paycheck-to-paycheck Americans: a plan to require every post office to offer basic banking services -- an alternative to predatory payday loans. She is coldbloodedly #MeToo, having shoved her former colleague Al Franken and the Clintons under the bus. And she has gotten ahead of the one-note socialist Senator Bernie Sanders on the idea of a job guarantee for everyone who wants to work. The problem there is cost (up to a half-trillion dollars, by some estimates) and the bureaucratic nightmare it could create. Gillibrand is swinging for the fences, even if she did the least well of major Democrats against Trump in recent polling. Much of the party's energy is coming from the Sanders wing; Sanders himself will be 79 on Election Day 2020 and he is not getting any less cranky. But don't overlook the enthusiasm generated by the Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke or Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana. They've stood up for the basic right of health care, and against the wrong of more tax cuts for the rich -- foundational positions favored by a majority of the country. Another prospect is the Senate's resident vegan, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He's got some Wall Street problems and is less populist than the mood of the country. But he has terrific political skills; he wouldn't need a slogan like Stronger Together. In the same class is the rookie Senator Kamala Harris of California. She's sharp, dynamic, with the right balance of ego and intellect. But how would a California liberal play in Scranton, Pa.? That brings us back to Scranton-born Biden. A new study suggests that fear of cultural displacement was a greater driver for Trump voters than economic anxiety -- identity politics for aging white males. It would seem to take some of the working-class-savior reasoning out of Uncle Joe's candidacy. But that analysis still doesn't adequately explain the millions of people who voted for both Barack Obama and Trump. That's where Biden comes in, and why he cleans up against Trump in early matchups. The problem is that he will be 77 on Election Day. Trump will be 74. He's old and he's angry, and will get only older and angrier. Build a better Biden, from our political lab, and you win. But maybe the current Biden is built to last, with just enough septuagenarian strut to end the dark age of Trump.

33433,"They've become unrevealing quip contests. Nervous managers of the scheduled 2020 presidential debates are shuffling the logistics and locations to deal with the threat of the coronavirus. But here's a better idea: Scrap them altogether. And not for health reasons. TD The debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership. In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure, likability. It should also go without saying, dignity. Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily on the verdict than their true value deserves. Perhaps the most substantive televised debate of all was the first one, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, which Nixon was considered to have won on substance on the radio, while the cooler and more appealing Kennedy won on television. Since these weren't true debates, the concept of ''winning'' one of these odd encounters was always amorphous. (To be sure, many questions by panels of journalists were designed less to stimulate debate than to challenge one of the candidates.) Over time, the debates came to resemble professional wrestling matches, and more substantive debates were widely panned in the press. Points went to snappy comebacks and one-liners. Witty remarks drew laughs from the audience and got repeated for days and remembered for years. Some of them have been less than hilarious, but they did the job of dominating reaction to a debate. Whatever substance existed was largely ignored. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan debated the incumbent Jimmy Carter, Carter made a serious point about Reagan's position on Medicare, and Reagan's riposte, ''There you go again,'' a non-answer if ever there was one, brought down the house and that was that. In the first 1984 debate, Reagan, seeking re-election and at 73, the oldest person to be nominated for the presidency, seemed tired and tended to wander off mentally at times. His lackluster performance caused panic among his staff. Democratic supporters of former Vice President Walter Mondale saw an opening. But another debate soon followed. Thoroughly prepared, Reagan got off the crack, ''I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.'' The audience roared and Mr. Mondale feigned a laugh, knowing he was cooked. Not even Reagan's ending of that debate, reminiscing about driving along the Pacific Coast and musing about time capsules, was enough to undermine his political prospects. Reagan's ''joke'' aimed at nullifying the age issue dominated the post-debate chatter. But what is the point or relevance of the carefully prepared one-liner? It's as spontaneous as a can of sardines. It's usually delivered from a memory chip in the mind, having been fashioned and rehearsed with aides. When is a president called upon to put down an interlocutor, be it a member of Congress or a foreign leader? This, by the way, isn't written out of any concern that Donald Trump will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine in a long string of such contests. The point is that ''winning'' a debate, however assessed, should be irrelevant, as are the debates themselves. The better way to pay attention to and choose among the presidential candidates is to follow the long campaign that so many complain about. The reason for such moaning has always been a mystery, because unless the campaign is taking place in your living room, you can simply switch it off. The key words are ''pay attention to,'' because over the stretch of 2015-2016 it wasn't impossible to see the implications of a Trump presidency. Not just the vulgarity but the ignorance and insensitivity and extreme narcissism were apparent more than a year before Election Day. Moreover, we didn't need the debates to tell us that Trump had chosen to be the P.T. Barnum of American politics. For him, it was (and still is) all about the show, about distracting the public from reality. It was obvious that Mr. Trump had no real affinity for the working-class people whose votes he was chasing. Nothing in his life suggested that his heart was with struggling workers and farmers. It wasn't impossible to know that he wasn't the skilled businessman he professed to be. His bankruptcies and shady business practices and discrimination against Black tenants were no secret. The debates took us nowhere nearer the realities about arguably the most disastrous president in our history. They became simply another tool in his arsenal. The party conventions, also vestigial organs of a political system that no longer exists, are close to being done away with, if not for the reasons they should be. There's no reason not to throw the presidential debates on the trash heap of useless (at best) rituals that are no help in our making such a fateful decision.

33434,"Whether or not they liked the result of the presidential election, many publishers were pleased this week to see that the country remained as divided as ever.   Partisan wrangling, after all, sent liberals and conservatives to bookstores in droves over the last year, seeking out volumes that largely confirmed their views of the other side. From ''Unfit for Command,'' the antipathetic account of Senator John Kerry's service in Vietnam, to ''Against All Enemies,'' an insider's critical look at the Bush administration's buildup to war in Iraq, partisan political books led the best-seller lists for much of the year.   TD Books bashing Mr. Kerry are likely to disappear now, and those attacking President Bush might similarly fade away, at least for a while, as Democrats regroup. But publishing executives say they expect that books emphasizing the differences between Republicans and Democrats will remain popular for a long time.   ''Good or bad, the split in America right now creates a publishing opportunity on both sides of the fence,'' Jack Romanos, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster, said. ''To publish for the middle of the road right now would be suicide.''   In the short term, Democrats are likely to search for explanations of what went wrong in the election, and the probability is high that at least one or two Kerry campaign officials will offer an insider's view of the campaign. Bush administration officials who do not return for a second term could set off aggressive bidding wars for the right to publish their memoirs. The most coveted of those prizes would probably be Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who has not said whether he will depart.   Already, a book by George J. Tenet, former director of central intelligence, has been shopped around by Robert B. Barnett, the Washington lawyer who negotiated the publishing deal for former President Bill Clinton. Twelve publishers are expected to bid on the Tenet book beginning next week, and executives said Mr. Tenet could receive an advance of several million dollars for a book to be published in late 2005 or 2006.   In the longer term, Republicans are likely to try to promote some forward-looking books, as factions of the party vie for control of the agenda. Marji Ross, president and publisher of Regnery Publishing, is planning to put a big effort behind ''Winning the Future,'' by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, which will lay out ''a new Contract With America,'' Ms. Ross said. In January, Regnery will publish ''Men in Black'' by Mark Levin, an assessment of judicial activism and its effect on the courts.   Ms. Ross said that old-fashioned attack books would not disappear, however. ''Any book needs to have a sense of vitality and energy,'' she said. ''We don't want to be publishing boring policy books. We want people to feel their blood pressure rise when they read our books.''   Brad Miner, executive editor of American Compass, a conservative book club that is part of Bookspan, the company that includes the Book-of-the-Month Club, said he sent an e-mail message to several publishers on Wednesday recommending that they consider books that delve into ''moral issues.'' According to polls, a plurality of voters said Tuesday that those issues had the biggest effect on their choice for president.   Even with Mr. Bush having won a majority of the votes, however, conservatives are unlikely to think they are controlling the agenda, Mr. Miner said. ''Most conservatives still will feel that the momentum of the culture is against them,'' he said. That is likely to mean continued demand for authors like Ann Coulter and others who seem easily to engender outrage at perceptions of liberal excess.   Liberals, meanwhile, are likely to try to figure out what happened. Already, three books that seek to explain how conservatives have secured so much real estate on the electoral map have surged in sales.   ''What's the Matter With Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,'' by Thomas Frank, ranked as high as No. 2 on the Amazon.com best-seller list in the days after the election. The book, published in June by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company, takes a polemical look at what Mr. Frank calls the Great Backlash, the popular revolt against what conservatives see as a liberal establishment.   Also shooting up the best-seller lists was ''Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,'' by George Lakoff, a linguist who argues that Republicans have succeeded in part by controlling the language of the debate on social issues in a way that portrays their views most favorably. The book was published in mid-September by Chelsea Green Publishing.   And gaining renewed attention was ''The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,'' published in May by Penguin Press. The book, by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, United States-based journalists for The Economist magazine, analyzes the history and sociology of the conservative movement.   John Sterling, the president and publisher of Henry Holt, said the company made plans several weeks ago to have Mr. Frank of ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' available for interviews if the Democrats lost, a factor he cited for at least some of the book's renewed popularity. Mr. Sterling also made sure there were plenty of books on hand. After shipping more than 100,000 since publication in June, Mr. Sterling said he expected 15,000 more to go out the door in the week after the election.

33410,"CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 29 -- Opponents of President Hugo Chavez stepped up preparations today for a general strike next week, heading toward another bruising confrontation with the government.   An anti-Chavez business leader, Carlos Fernandez, said the strike would start early Monday. The other main organizer, Carlos Ortega, a union leader, said, ''The situation is unsustainable.''  TD  As political tensions mounted before the strike, debate raged over a decision by the nation's electoral authorities to call a referendum for Feb. 2 on Mr. Chavez's presidency. The government, backed by a Supreme Court ruling that appeared to contradict the National Election Council decision on Thursday, rejected the referendum as illegal and unconstitutional.   But the electoral body said today that the referendum requested by the opposition was valid and should go ahead.

33411,"WASHINGTON -- Leading Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday reacted skeptically to the idea of overhauling surveillance laws to make it easier to wiretap people who communicate online rather than by telephone, a major priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawmakers expressed their concerns at a House hearing devoted to a problem that law enforcement officials call ''going dark'' -- investigators' inability to carry out court-approved wiretap orders when the people who are the targets communicate using services that lack a surveillance capability. TD The F.B.I. has been quietly laying the groundwork for years for a push to require Internet-based communications services -- like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerry and Skype -- to design their systems with a built-in way to comply with wiretap orders. On Thursday, the bureau made its first full airing of the ''going dark'' problem. ''Due to the revolutionary expansion of communications technology in recent years, the government finds that it is rapidly losing ground in its ability to execute court orders with respect to Internet-based communications,'' said the F.B.I.'s general counsel, Valerie Caproni. A 1994 law requires phone companies to build their networks with the capability of immediately starting to intercept a user's communications when the company is presented with a wiretap order. But that law does not cover Internet-based communication providers. As a result, while they, too, are subject to court wiretap orders, they are often unable to comply, for technical reasons, when presented with one. Ms. Caproni stopped short of making any specific legislative proposal, saying that the Obama administration was still debating the issue internally. Last fall, The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials were developing a bill that would impose new regulations on Internet communications companies and phone and broadband carriers, making them easier to wiretap. ''We don't have a specific request yet,'' Ms. Caproni said. ''The administration does not yet have a proposal. It is something that is actively being discussed within the administration, and I am optimistic that we will have a proposal in the near future.'' Still, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, was one of several lawmakers who said he was likely to greet such a proposal with skepticism. Forcing Internet communications services to build in ''back doors'' for law enforcement surveillance, he said, would hamper innovation and create vulnerabilities for hackers and foreign governments to exploit. ''Requiring back doors in all communications systems by law runs counter to how the Internet works and may make it impossible for some companies to offer their services,'' Mr. Conyers said. Several lawmakers of both parties raised concerns about how such a mandate would affect the competitiveness of Internet companies that operate in the United States. Still, several Republicans suggested sympathy with law enforcement officials' fear that changing technology could hamper their ability to investigate criminals and terrorists. Ms. Caproni emphasized that the F.B.I. was not seeking new surveillance powers, but rather a way to keep its existing powers from eroding. She also said the F.B.I. was not seeking a decryption key that would allow the government to directly intercept and unscramble secure communications. Rather, she said, the bureau hoped to require communication service providers to deploy, within their own systems, a wiretapping capability. The provider would have to be able to isolate, intercept and deliver to the government a particular user's communications in response to a wiretap order. Susan Landau, a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study fellow and former Sun Microsystems engineer, argued against building interception systems within a service, citing high-profile cases in which hackers exploited such mechanisms in Greece and Italy to illegally spy on politicians and other prominent people. Ms. Caproni spoke with caution about several aspects of the F.B.I.'s broad goals that have attracted controversy. For example, law enforcement officials have said in the past that all companies that facilitate communications should be able to provide a plain-text version of messages in response to a wiretap order. Such a mandate could require major changes for companies like Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry Enterprise Server system relays encrypted messages that the company says it cannot unscramble. Last year, Research in Motion came into conflict with several governments, including in India and the United Arab Emirates, over their inability to conduct surveillance of messages sent via its encrypted service. Asked about encryption, Ms. Caproni said that if a provider encrypted communications but had the ability to decrypt them, then it should be required to give law enforcement unscrambled versions. And she said that if an individual encrypted his own communications, investigators would have to find some other way to monitor that person. But crucially, she did not directly address whether a service provider should be allowed to encrypt a user's communications in such a way that the provider is unable to unscramble them -- even if a court orders it to do so. The hearing came a day after the release of several hundred pages of internal F.B.I. documents showing that the bureau has been working with great urgency to push to change legislation for years. The documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group. The documents shed new light on how the F.B.I.'s interest in the ''going dark'' problem predates the Obama administration. The bureau commissioned a study from the RAND Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton several years ago, and it conducted surveys of law enforcement officials seeking examples of encountering obstacles to carrying out wiretap orders. One such document redacted a legislative proposal for the ''going dark'' surveillance issue. But beneath it, a related proposal was left uncensored: electronic communications service providers, it said, should be required ''to retain for two years records showing the origination and termination of communications.'' Currently, law enforcement agencies are able to obtain such records only if the provider has chosen to preserve them for its own purposes, like billing.

33412,"WASHINGTON -- George W. Bush has just placed his faith in Saddam Hussein's reliability. If the Iraqi tyrant remains true to form -- again misreading America's once-in-a-decade resolve -- Bush's recently evolved Four Resolution Strategy will bring about his overthrow.   Resolution No. 1 is to come from the U.S. Congress. In mid-October, after a debate between ''Here's the case'' Republicans and ''What was that case again?'' Democrats, Congress will pass a resolution containing the big After: after the U.N. Security Council has made a final effort to insert unfetterable inspectors, and that fails, then the president will be authorized to enforce the terms of the 1991 surrender. But come back again after the election before you bomb anybody.  TD  Resolution No. 2 comes from the U.N.: Submit to intrusive inspections or we may not be able to restrain those bellicose Americans. This is your last chance; this time we mean it.   Resolution No. 3 comes from the Congress, after Saddam has allowed U.N. inspectors in and again begun haggling over where they can go and when. The gist: O.K., Mr. President, you can commence firing, but you'd better have U.N. permission, allies with you and an Iraqi George Washington in the wings.   Resolution No. 4, again from the U.N.: This time, we really really mean it. If you don't cut out the rope-a-dope, we'll pull our frustrated inspectors out next week, lest they be hit by bombers from inpatient member nations. And you'd better not hold our people hostage or there'll be war-crime trials for all officers over the rank of lieutenant.   I deduce this possible drawn-out scenario from a single letter of a single word in President Bush's speech: U.N. resolutions, plural. By mollifying the Baker-Scowcroft-Hagel set, which reflects his father's views, the president has promised to go one U.N. resolution too far.   The other indication of a four-resolution fallback comes from last weekend's reactions of presidential hopefuls. On the Senate Democratic spectrum from hawkish Lieberman-Edwards to dovish Daschle-Kerry, the message has gone forth: We're going to have to vote on this before the election, so let's engage the White House in drawing up a resolution before the election that we can back out of in another resolution afterward.   That's because the original Democratic position -- let's not vote before the election lest the voters' jingoistic views affect our decision -- was untenable. No governmental decision is more important than going to war to prevent an attack, and voters have a right and an obligation to find out where their representatives stand.   In the same way, President Bush had to abandon the notion that all he had to do was ''consult'' with Congressional leaders. He needs Congressional authorization to wage war, just as Congress needs to make its views known by a difficult vote in a timely fashion. Such mutual deference between branches is essential.   Bush softened his position substantially by deferring to the U.N. as well. He covered that softening with tough words clearly implying ''or else,'' and reminding the U.N. of its vulnerability by raising the specter of the feckless League of Nations. His hard words to cloak accommodation fooled no national leaders, but gave Russia and France cover to protect their interests after the U.S. deposes their debtor and customer in Baghdad.   But the quadruple-ultimata strategy adopted by Bush, while it wins praise for uncowboyesque caution from multilateralist media and relieved U.N. officials, depends entirely on the dependability of Saddam.   For this approach to succeed in overthrowing the dangerous dictatorship, the White House is relying on Baghdad to show not merely consistency in recalcitrance, but an insufferable, infuriating intractability in intransigence. Bush is betting that Saddam will (a) reject the U.N resolutions as humiliating or (b) accept the final-final warning and then negotiate endlessly with the inspectors so as to make their mission impossible.   The basis for this gamble is Bush's certainty, based on the logical extrapolation of past and present intelligence reports, that Saddam has evidence of mass-murder weaponry to hide. The Iraqi dictator cannot accede to coercive inspection, enforced by U.N. troops, without blowing up what has cost him more than $100 billion in a decade's oil revenues to build.   That would not be like Saddam. And on that presumed defiance rests Bush's diplomatic strategy.

33413,"WASHINGTON, March 26 -- The World Trade Organization ruled today that the steel tariffs imposed by President Bush last year were illegal.   The administration said it would appeal the decision.  TD  While the trade decision was called interim, with the final report expected next month, it is rare for an interim decision to be reversed. If the United States loses next month, European and other nations could impose trade sanctions of comparable value against the United States.   Last spring, Mr. Bush imposed tariffs of nearly 30 percent on most types of steel imported from Europe, Asia and South America, the biggest government action to protect an industry in several decades. While it was praised by the steel industry and trade unionists, the move was criticized by free trade advocates and companies that use steel in manufacturing.   The case against the tariffs was brought by the European Union, which accused the United States of illegally protecting the steel industry. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, called the tariffs ''unjustified, highly protectionist U.S. measures.''   ''I am in no doubt that the U.S. will lose this case, as it has lost all six previous safeguard cases,'' Mr. Lamy said when the initial case was brought against the United States.   But there was no celebratory statement or any comment from the Europeans today. All spokesmen said they would not discuss an interim decision, but foreign officials also said Europe wanted to avoid creating a further division with the United States in a time of war.   Today's ruling, which was not a surprise, was the second major loss for the United States at the W.T.O. in the last year. The trade panel awarded Europe the right to impose $4 billion worth of trade sanctions against the United States for giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations.   When administration officials imposed the steel tariffs they said they were legal under provisions in the world trading rules allowing a response to a surge of steel imports.   The tariffs were meant to help the American steel industry find its footing in the global market. American trade officials said today that the strategy worked.   ''The domestic steel industry has undergone an unprecedented level of consolidation and restructuring over the last year that have made it more competitive,'' said one American trade official, who insisted on not being identified.   Democratic lawmakers criticized the trade decision, citing a United States International Trade Commission study done before the tariffs were imposed that showed imports were seriously injuring important parts of the American steel industry. They said the W.T.O. had exceeded its authority.   ''I support the goal of an international trading system,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ''But we have a growing problem with dispute settlement decisions that are inventing obligations and requirements to which the United States and other countries never agreed. Ultimately, these types of decisions will only undermine confidence in the W.T.O.''   Some Democrats said the administration was partly to blame for failing to adopt an aggressive strategy to end a series of rulings against the United States.   Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, accused the administration of overseeing the loss of 13 of 15 cases brought against the United States since 2001.   ''This decision furthers a trend that jeopardizes the credibility of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement system and must serve as a wake-up call for the administration,'' Mr. Levin said.   In Congressional hearings today, steel officials and union representatives praised the tariffs. Leo W. Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers of America, told lawmakers that they should not forget the history that led to the president's decision to impose the steel tariffs. For several years, he said, the domestic steel industry was ''under attack from foreign producers, aided and abetted by foreign governments through subsidies and other market manipulations.''   ''The consequences of this assault have been disastrous for our steelworkers and for the American steel industry,'' Mr. Gerard said.   The result, he said, was that 37 companies were forced into bankruptcy, 54,000 steel workers lost their jobs, and pension plans and health care programs were being scaled back for retirees, widows and other dependents.   But some manufacturers have complained that the tariffs have led to higher prices for steel and hurt their companies.   Wes Smith, the president of the E&E Manufacturing Company, with 250 employees in Plymouth, Mich., testified that the tariffs and rising cost of steel amounted to a new tax for him.   ''We are willing to meet the challenge of competing with the Asians,'' Mr. Smith said. ''However, we cannot do that with our hands tied behind our backs by having our government tax our largest input by 30 percent.''

33414,"If you listened to the Republican candidates this year, you heard a conventional set of arguments. But if you go online, you can find a vibrant and increasingly influential center-right conversation. Most of the young writers and bloggers in this conversation intermingle, but they can be grouped, for clarity's sake, around a few hot spots: Paleoconservatives. The American Conservative has become one of the more dynamic spots on the political Web. Writers like Rod Dreher and Daniel Larison tend to be suspicious of bigness: big corporations, big government, a big military, concentrated power and concentrated wealth. Writers at that Web site, and at the temperamentally aligned Front Porch Republic, treasure tight communities and local bonds. They're alert to the ways capitalism can erode community. Dispositionally, they are more Walker Percy than Pat Robertson. TD Larison focuses on what he calls the imperial tendencies of both the Bush and Obama foreign policies. He crusades against what he sees as the unchecked killing power of drone strikes and champions a more modest and noninterventionist foreign policy. Lower-Middle Reformists. Reihan Salam, a writer for National Review, E21 and others, recently pointed out that there are two stories about where the Republican Party should go next. There is the upper-middle reform story: Republicans should soften their tone on the social issues to win over suburban voters along the coasts. Then there is a lower-middle reform story: Republicans should focus on the specific economic concerns of the multiethnic working class. Salam promotes the latter. This means acknowledging that working-class concerns are not what they were in the 1980s. The income tax is less burdensome than the payroll tax. Family disruption undermines social mobility. Republicans, he argues, should keep the social conservatism, which reinforces families, and supplement it with an agenda that supports upward mobility and social capital. Similarly, Henry Olsen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued for a Republican Party that listens more closely to working-class concerns. Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review has argued for family-friendly tax credits and other measures that reinforce middle-class dignity. Jim Manzi wrote a seminal article in National Affairs on the need to promote innovation while reducing inequality. Soft Libertarians. Some of the most influential bloggers on the right, like Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok and Megan McArdle, start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way. Many of these market-oriented writers emphasize that being pro-market is not the same as being pro-business. Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago published an influential book, ''A Capitalism for the People,'' that took aim at crony capitalism. Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner does muckraking reporting on corporate-federal collusion. Rising star Derek Khanna wrote a heralded paper on intellectual property rights for the House Republican Study Committee that was withdrawn by higher-ups in the party, presumably because it differed from the usual lobbyist-driven position. There are a number of unpredictable libertarian-leaning writers, including Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic on civil liberties issues, and Eugene Volokh on legal and free speech concerns. Burkean Revivalists. This group includes young conservatives whose intellectual roots go back to the organic vision of society described best by Edmund Burke but who are still deeply enmeshed in current policy debates. Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs is one of the two or three most influential young writers in politics today. He argues that we are now witnessing the fiscal crisis of the entitlement state, exemplified most of all by exploding health care costs. His magazine promotes a big agenda of institutional modernization. The lawyer Adam J. White has argued for an approach to jurisprudence and regulatory affairs based on modesty, but not a doctrinaire clinging to original intent. Ryan Streeter of Indiana champions civil-society conservatism, an updated version of the Jack Kemp style. By and large, these diverse writers did not grow up in the age of Reagan and are not trying to recapture it. They disdain what you might call Donor Base Republicanism. Most important, they matured intellectually within a far-reaching Web-based conversation. In contrast to many members of the conservative political-entertainment complex, they are data-driven, empirical and low-key in tone. They are united more by a style of feedback and mutual scrutiny than by a common agenda. Some politically unorthodox people in this conversation, such as Josh Barro of Bloomberg View, Meghan Clyne of National Affairs and Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute, specialize in puncturing sentimentality and groupthink. Since Nov. 6, the G.O.P. has experienced an epidemic of open-mindedness. The party may evolve quickly.

The City Council voted 5 to 4 late Monday to put the ''Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance'' to a vote. Abortion foes gathered enough petition signatures to require the council to either approve the law or put it to voters. Activists on both sides say it would be the first municipal ban on abortion. ''It is a new strategy,'' said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, which helped push the measure. ''There is more than one way to close an abortion clinic.'' The measure states that ''pain receptors are present throughout the unborn child's entire body'' at 20 weeks. TD",[],perso
33416,"WASHINGTON -- Senator Barack Obama informed two of his top three vice-presidential prospects Friday night that he would not be choosing them, Democratic officials said, encouraging a consensus within the party that he had settled on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. Mr. Obama's campaign and aides to Mr. Biden declined to comment. But Mr. Obama's notification to the two other candidates -- Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia -- was confirmed by senior associates of both men. TD The formal announcement was scheduled to be made in the form of text messages and e-mail messages sent to thousands of Obama supporters early Saturday. Mr. Obama and his running mate are scheduled to appear at an afternoon rally at the Old Statehouse in Springfield, Ill., the same place where Mr. Obama announced his candidacy for president 18 months ago. Mr. Obama's selection process has been so secretive that most people in his campaign headquarters still did not know what was going on Friday evening. Democrats were not ruling out the possibility that Mr. Obama could surprise the party with a choice other than Mr. Biden. Should Mr. Obama in fact chose Mr. Biden, he would be moving to plug what many Democrats see as a hole in his resume, turning to a six-term senator who is a leading authority on foreign policy. Mr. Biden's selection would amount to a critical strategic choice: to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about shortfalls in Mr. Obama's background, rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce Mr. Obama's message of change. Mr. Biden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and moves easily among foreign leaders and diplomats. Although he initially voted to authorize the war -- Mr. Obama has opposed the war from the start -- Mr. Biden has become a persistent critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq. Mr. Biden would complement Mr. Obama's antiwar position in the general election match-up against Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee, who has supported the war. Mr. Biden has a reputation for at times talking himself into trouble, and he was not always seen as a natural partner for Mr. Obama. A year ago, when he was himself running for the White House, Mr. Biden said Mr. Obama was ''not yet ready'' for the presidency. Some associates of Mr. Biden were informed by the Obama campaign to stand ready for television interviews on Saturday. Mr. Biden is Catholic, giving him appeal to that important voting bloc, though he favors abortion rights. He was born in Scranton, Pa., a swing state where he remains well known. Mr. Biden is up for re-election to the Senate this year, and he would presumably run for both positions simultaneously were he on the presidential ticket. Mr. Biden was elected to the Senate in 1972 when he was 29 and reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in. He served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee before taking over at Foreign Relations and has a long legislative record on issues such as law enforcement in addition to his work on international policy. Mr. Obama is announcing his choice as he moves into a critical stage of his campaign, preparing for the Democratic Party's four-day convention in Denver, which begins Monday. Mr. Obama's aides viewed the introduction of his vice-presidential choice as the beginning of a weeklong stretch in which Mr. Obama hopes to dominate the stage and position himself for the fall campaign. Mr. Biden is on what is by all accounts a relatively short list of possibilities. In addition to Mr. Bayh and Mr. Kaine, Mr. Obama also called Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut on Friday to inform him that he had chosen someone else, according to Democrats familiar with the race. As the selection process moved to an end, a Democrat who had once been viewed as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, whom Mr. Obama had defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- slipped out of contention. While the decision was being closely held inside the Obama campaign, aides across the country were told late Friday to begin informing local officials about the vice-presidential decision on Saturday morning. As the speculation grew, Mr. Obama spent the day in Chicago, practicing his convention speech and having dinner with his family. As he walked into a downtown restaurant, reporters yelled, ''Where's the text?'' He responded with a laugh, not saying a word as he walked inside. The pace of speculation quickened at the end of a day in which Mr. Obama's success at keeping his search secret -- with a combination of campaign discipline and political gamesmanship -- kept the world waiting and guessing. CNN showed a split screen of the homes of people considered to be top contenders as well as Midway Airport in Chicago, where the pick might presumably land at some point. News reports tracked the whereabouts of the families of Mr. Biden and Mr. Bayh with an intensity usually reserved for fleeing felons. After days devoted to reviewing the political pluses and minuses of the possibilities, news reports spiced things up by injecting a new name into the mix, Representative Chet Edwards of Texas, touching off a flurry of analyses. (Associates of Mr. Obama said he was never a serious contender for the nomination. ) On the Fox News Channel, the vice-presidential saga shared the stage with stories like the one about a North Carolina man who caught a record catfish with his granddaughter's Barbie fishing rod. But it was Mr. Obama who was really reeling them in, building the suspense over the choice in a strategic approach that left party operatives straining to decide whether it was a stroke of genius or a miscalculation. But a certain weariness of the vice-presidential game was emerging in some quarters, leaving other Democrats to wonder privately whether Mr. Obama's campaign was getting too cute in playing ''catch me if you can'' with the news media at the expense of a more resonant message on economic issues. Several Democratic strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern that Mr. Obama was losing an opportunity to make the most of the news of his running mate by announcing too closely to the nominating convention. That said, Mr. Obama clearly was not looking to his vice-presidential selection as a major moment in his presidential bid, and the relatively short roll-out, going into the convention, was designed to prevent the second wave of often negative re-examination news stories that follow selections like this. The anticipation of the text message promised by the Obama campaign and the hair-trigger posture of the press did leave some vulnerable to hoaxes. The apparent first big victim: The Wall Street Journal, which posted an urgent bulletin on Friday reporting that Mr. Obama had selected Mr. Kaine as his running mate. It immediately retracted the report, and the paper issued an apology: ''The Journal news department was sent an erroneous announcement about the selection of a vice presidential candidate for Barack Obama. Once we realized the announcement was erroneous, we immediately withdrew the headline. We regret any inconvenience this caused our readers.''

33418,"Most contributors to political campaigns are probably unaware that their money, under federal and state laws, can be used for all sorts of purposes. It can be channeled to other candidates, stored away for a future campaign or spent on unrelated expenses. A prominent New Jersey politician recently tried to use campaign funds to pay his defense lawyers. The state's election officials were right to turn him down.     Wayne R. Bryant, a former Democratic state senator, has been charged by federal prosecutors with using his position to get a no-show job at the state's medical college. Prosecutors say he showed his gratitude by directing millions of dollars in grants to the school. Mr. Bryant, a former chair of the appropriations committee, who apparently knows no shame, asked the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission for permission to pay his legal bills from his campaign coffers.     TD The request is unacceptable on its face. When people contribute to a candidate, they are being asked to support the democratic process. It is unlikely that they are expecting their dollars to help their preferred candidate fend off federal corruption charges.     Elected officials have to be able to raise money for legal defense funds. When they do, however, they should tell prospective contributors that their money will be used to pay lawyers' bills.     Mr. Bryant isn't the only politician willing to take such advantage of his contributors. At the federal level, former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, used campaign funds to help pay for his defense against bribery charges. More recently, Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, used campaign money to pay lawyers' fees related to his well-known encounter at an airport men's room.     Mr. Bryant argued that his criminal charges arose out of his work as an officeholder. But it is a very dim view of public service to say that contributors should expect that a candidate may naturally face criminal charges. New Jersey's commission, to its credit, refused to go along, but this should not be a gray area. Lawmakers in New Jersey and in Washington should expressly bar the use of campaign contributions to pay legal bills.     Until then, we would at least like to see some truth in advertising. If candidates want to preserve their options, they should be required to tell contributors that their money will go to one of two important causes: giving the people the best possible quality of government or, failing that, fighting to keep themselves out of jail.

33419,"WASHINGTON -- Government investigators said Friday that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state, stating unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Mrs. Clinton has said for months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house so she would not have to carry both a personal phone and a work phone. Her campaign said Friday that any government secrets found on the server had been classified after the fact. TD But the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies said the information they found was classified when it was sent and remains so now. Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and such information can be sent or stored only on computer networks with special safeguards. ''This classified information never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,'' Steve A. Linick, the State Department inspector general, said in a statement signed by him and I. Charles McCullough III, the inspector general for the intelligence community. The findings by the two inspectors general raise new questions about Mrs. Clinton's use of her personal email at the State Department, a practice that since March has been criticized by her Republican adversaries as well as advocates of open government, and has made some Democrats uneasy. Voters, however, do not appear swayed by the issue, according to polls. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said the classified information had originated with the nation's intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. It is against the law for someone to receive a classified document or briefing and then summarize that information in an unclassified email. The two investigators did not say whether Mrs. Clinton sent or received the emails. If she received them, it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified. The inspectors general did not address whether they believed Mrs. Clinton should have known such information was not appropriate for her personal email. Regardless, the disclosure is an example of an unforeseen consequence of Mrs. Clinton's unusual computer setup. Security experts have questioned whether her practice made government secrets more vulnerable to security risks and hacking. Exactly how much classified information Mrs. Clinton had on the server is unclear. Investigators said they searched a small sample of 40 emails and found four that contained government secrets. But Mr. McCullough said in a separate statement that although the State Department had granted limited access to its own inspector general, the department rejected Mr. McCullough's request for access to the 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton said were government-related and gave to the State Department. Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, is ''purported'' to also have copies of the 30,000 emails on a thumb drive, according to Mr. McCullough. Campaigning in New York on Friday, Mrs. Clinton pledged to cooperate with inquiries into her emails, but also said she would stay focused on the issues at the heart of her presidential campaign. ''We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But I'm also going to stay focused on the issues, particularly the big issues, that really matter to American families.'' The discovery of the four emails prompted Mr. McCullough to refer the matter to F.B.I. counterintelligence agents, who investigate crimes related to the mishandling of classified information. On Thursday night and again Friday morning, the Justice Department referred to the matter as a ''criminal referral,'' but later Friday dropped the word ''criminal.'' The inspectors general said late Friday that it was a ''security referral'' intended to alert authorities that ''classified information may exist on at least one private server and thumb drive that are not in the government's possession.'' Irrespective of the terminology, the referral raises the possibility of a Justice Department investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails as she campaigns for president. Polls show she is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by a wide margin. Mishandling classified information is a crime. Justice Department officials said no decision had been made about whether to open a criminal investigation. The refusal by the State Department to give Mr. McCullough access to the emails has reignited calls by Republicans for Mrs. Clinton to hand over the server that she used to house the personal email account. ''If Secretary Clinton truly has nothing to hide, she can prove it by immediately turning over her server to the proper authorities and allowing them to examine the complete record,'' Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on Friday. ''Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing.'' The Justice Department is typically reluctant to open politically charged investigations unless there is clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing. For example, authorities said last year that they would not open an investigation into dueling claims by the C.I.A. and the Senate Intelligence Committee in a dispute that also centered around access to classified information.

33420,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 -- Federal officials moved to step up security at financial centers and federal buildings in Washington and the New York City area on Monday in response to new intelligence about possible threats by Al Qaeda, even as some terrorism experts worried that the increased security might simply prompt terrorists to choose other targets.   ''You harden one target, you soften another,'' said John Gannon, the former deputy director for intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency who is staff director for the House Homeland Security Committee.   TD ''We've got our finger in the dike in the right places on this one, but we have to look for other holes that the terrorists might come through,'' said Mr. Gannon, who was briefed over the weekend on the increased terror threat.   Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security, plans to meet on Tuesday in Manhattan with Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, as well as chief executives from leading companies, and he will review new measures put in place to guard financial institutions, officials said.   On Sunday, Mr. Ridge raised the threat level to the second highest, orange, or ''high risk,'' for the financial sectors in New York City, northern New Jersey and Washington because of intelligence pointing to Qaeda reconnaissance missions aimed at the financial industry. Mr. Ridge listed five potential targets, including the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup buildings in Manhattan.   ''The secretary wants to see firsthand the new protective measures that have been put in place and offer employees a message of reassurance,'' said Brian Roehrkasse, the department's spokesman.   Domestic security officials continued working with local law enforcement agencies and private institutions in Washington and the New York area on Monday to bolster security in and around the financial institutions by increasing visitor inspections, camera surveillance, armed patrols, canine teams and other measures, officials said.   Even before the latest threat information, federal officials were using sophisticated air-monitoring devices at sites in Manhattan, Newark and Washington to help avert biological attacks. The air monitoring will continue, but there is no plan to expand the use of the devices, officials said.   At the same time, federal officials expanded security measures for possible targets beyond the financial sector. Some security personnel who guard federal buildings in New York City and Washington were told to expect increased workloads, officials said. And the Capitol Police said cars traveling through the Capitol complex -- including on Independence and Constitution Avenues -- would have to pass through a cordon of traffic barriers and police officers.   Chief Terrance W. Gainer of the United States Capitol Police said at a news conference on Monday that most vehicles would be allowed to pass slowly but that some could be pulled aside to be searched. One section of First Street on the Senate side of the Capitol will be closed north of Constitution to D Street.   Chief Gainer said 300 officers would be involved in the new security steps, which also include 14 vehicle checkpoints around the Capitol, and the costs could reach $3 million a month. Officials said the moves were long overdue but not directly related to Sunday's raised threat level.   A principal goal, officials said, is visibility.   ''It's important to send the message out to the public and to the terrorists that these are not soft targets,'' said one homeland security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''These are hardened targets, and that acts as a deterrent.''   Officials said they believe that increased visibility and public awareness could help to disrupt a terrorist plot or to discourage terrorists from carrying one out, as officials think happened when a suspected Qaeda operative believed to be studying the Brooklyn Bridge in 2003 reported that security was ''too hot.''   But with increased security at financial centers like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, there comes the risk that plotters could switch plans and pick a new target.   In the past, security and intelligence experts said, Al Qaeda has proved adept at shifting its targets in response to tightened security.   ''The problem is that they will take whatever time is necessary to get their operatives in place,'' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University at San Bernardino who studies terrorism and consults with the federal government on the issue.   ''Half this battle is psychological, and the mere show of force by the government at these locations will put people temporarily at ease,'' Professor Levin said. ''But in the long term, the difficulty you face is that people get complacent and things go back to business as usual, and that's what the terrorists want.''   Domestic security officials said they had no clear indication how long the code-orange alert would remain in place because the intelligence -- gathered from a recent arrest of a suspected Qaeda computer engineer in Pakistan -- did not indicate when a plot might be carried out.   ''We'll continue to assess the threats, and we'll see where it leads us,'' Mr. Roehrkasse said.

33422,"Like many areas around the country, Washington and its suburbs are embracing positive momentum in data on infections to push ahead. WASHINGTON -- The leaders around the nation's capital are pushing forward with plans to reopen the region, hoping they are close enough to their public health goals to move toward normalcy despite coronavirus infection rates that have alarmed federal officials. TD ''I want to make sure we all understand that moving into Phase 1 means that more people can get infected,'' Muriel E. Bowser, Washington's mayor, said on Wednesday as she announced that parts of the city would begin to reopen on Friday. ''It cannot be said enough: Every single one of us has a role to play.'' The northern suburbs of Virginia will also begin limited reopenings on Friday, while suburban counties in Maryland remain shuttered, underscoring the challenges that the region faces with boundaries that its residents crisscross daily. The Washington metropolitan area, home to 6.2 million people, is among the most interconnected regions in the nation, with a shared public transportation system and entwined economies. The region's unusual symbiosis is further complicated by the movements of congressional lawmakers in and out of town and a mercurial White House, all posing difficulties for the governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor of the District of Columbia -- a city that lacks the autonomy of states with the same or smaller populations -- as they move to bring their economies back to life. On Tuesday, in a private call with the nation's governors, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, singled out the Washington region as among a handful of metropolitan areas where positive coronavirus test rates remain above 10 percent. In the call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Birx also mentioned Baltimore and Richmond, the largest nearby cities. On Wednesday, Virginia reported 45 new deaths, the third day in a row of record increases. A majority of them were in the Washington suburbs, where the overall number of infections remains far higher than in the rest of the commonwealth. Nonetheless, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has said that because Northern Virginia health officials judged that the region had met four of the six metrics for reopening, the area would begin to do so on Friday, joining the less-affected parts of the commonwealth. That day, Virginia will also begin a statewide mask requirement for indoor businesses. The growth rates of new cases and deaths in the District of Columbia have mostly held steady at a time when rates have mostly fallen elsewhere in the country, underscoring the city's difficulty in fully reversing the course of the virus, as Dr. Birx would like to see. In Maryland, the two counties bordering Washington have opted to maintain stay-at-home orders as Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has moved to slowly open the state while leaving counties to decide their own path. On Wednesday, Marc Elrich, the county executive in Montgomery County, a sprawling and diverse suburb across the district line where the most Maryland deaths have occurred, said it would begin restricted reopenings in ''a matter of days.'' Another close-in suburb, Prince George's County -- which has nearly 30 percent of Maryland's cases even though it holds only 15 percent of the state's population -- is expected to take similar measures soon. A much-celebrated tranche of tests that Mr. Hogan procured from South Korea has not really made its way into the Maryland counties as many local leaders expected, and the counties closest to the nation's capital -- areas with the highest rates of infection and death -- have scrambled to obtain their own tests. ''Maryland's high positive infection rate, one of the highest in the country, shows just how limited our state's testing capacity is,'' said Representative Anthony G. Brown, a Democrat. ''We are not testing beyond our sickest residents, leaving us mostly blind to the broader community spread that is likely occurring.'' ''Local jurisdictions,'' he said, ''have been left to fend for themselves to get adequate testing and medical supplies in place. This is a threat to public health.'' Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan, noted that the governor had said that some components were still needed for the tests, which he got through a contact of his wife, to be used widely around the state. ''We have consistently directed much of the state's response to hardest-hit areas, with Montgomery and Prince George's receiving the most testing, the most hospitals,'' he said. In Washington, the racial disparities in death rates have been stark. For instance, Ward 4, a neighborhood with a mix of poor, middle-class and wealthy residents, has more infections -- 1,771 total -- than any other, largely attributed to workers in so-called essential jobs who take public transportation and often live in dense environments. But there have been only 63 deaths in that area. In Ward 8, one of the city's poorest areas, the 1,174 cases are in the middle of infection rates for the city's eight wards, but the number of deaths, 92, is the highest in the city. The difference, local health care experts said, most likely stems from the fact that Ward 4 is 47 percent black, while Ward 8 is 92 percent black. The city's black residents are more likely to be obese and have diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, all major risk factors for death with the coronavirus. ''I would add to the resource issue the black population's historically complex relationship with health care,'' said Yesim Sayin Taylor, the executive director of the D.C. Policy Center, a research organization. Ward 8 has far fewer health care resources than the rest of the city, and many residents may be getting tested for the coronavirus at a far later stage than other city residents. Poverty among black residents in Ward 8 may help explain why their death rates are higher than those of black residents in Prince George's County, where infection rates are high but deaths lag Montgomery County. Black residents make up about 62 percent of the Prince George's population, but income levels are higher. ''Wealth allows families to weather an unexpected emergency like Covid-19,'' said Danyelle Solomon, the vice president for race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. She noted that in Washington, black residents were 4.5 times more likely to experience poverty than their white counterparts, while in Maryland they were two times more likely. ''It has long been known that only 15 to 20 percent of good health is determined by medical care, and the other 80 percent is determined by the social determinants of health,'' said George A. Jones, the chief executive of Bread for the City, which provides food and services for poor residents of Washington. ''There is a phenomenon called 'weathering' that is used to describe African-Americans' poor health outcomes.'' Weathering ''is caused by the chronic stress of economic and social struggles, which accelerates the rate of health decline,'' he said. ''Racism in social and economic systems creates a chronic stress that causes worse health outcomes.''

33423,"Yes, the American military still uses bayonets, and quite a few. There are horses too. When Mitt Romney complained during Monday night's presidential debate that the Navy ""is smaller now than at any time since 1917,"" President Obama shot back with ""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.'' Mr. Obama's line, meant to underscore that military capability matters more than sheer numbers, quickly ignited a fire on the Internet. TD Marines quickly jumped in to say that they still attach bayonets to the end of their rifles, either the M4, M16 or M27. Of course, Mr. Obama did not say that the military has no bayonets and horses at all -- just that there were fewer now than then. While that is almost certainly true (the United States government drafted four million men in World War I), the 2012 United States Marine Corps still has more than 175,000 bayonets - or nearly one for each of the 197,500 current active-duty Marines. Marines carry bayonets when they deploy overseas, typically in sheaths attached to their body armor. In the martial arts training that all Marines receive, they are taught to attach them to their rifles in difficult or close-quarters situations. ""Basically when you're in a hand-to-hand-combat situation, if you're out of ammo and if your rifle malfunctions, you can attach the bayonet and still kill somebody,'' said Capt. Kendra Motz, a Marine Corps spokeswoman. The bayonet blade is 7 inches long. Horses are still used for funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and in formal military parades. One of their most well-known uses in recent years was in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, when elite teams of American commandos on horseback radioed in airstrikes to American pilots with the enemy's exact position. As for the Navy, Mr. Romney is right that it is the smallest since 1917, the year the United States entered World War I. The war buildup is easy to see in Navy statistics: In 1917 there were 342 ships in the Navy compared with 245 ships the year before. At the end of 2011, there were 285 ships in the Navy. That's a slight increase from the George W. Bush administration, when in 2007 there were 278 ships. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

33424,"Washington Tax Break Urged for Firms That Keep Health Benefits A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including the chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House and the Senate, asked the Internal Revenue Service on Monday to allow companies that continue paying the cost of health benefits for furloughed workers to remain eligible for a new tax credit. The tax credit essentially reimburses companies for up to half the wages they continue to pay workers who are furloughed amid the coronavirus pandemic. The credit, meant to encourage companies to keep paying workers amid virus-induced shutdowns, was part of an economic rescue package that passed Congress with bipartisan support. President Trump signed it in March. The lawmakers' concern stems from guidance that I.R.S. officials issued governing which companies are eligible for the credit, and to what degree. Companies qualify if they reduce employees' hours -- and thus, their pay -- amid the pandemic, but do not lay them off entirely. But it rules out benefits for companies that stop paying wages to their workers but continue to pay the cost of their health benefits. If a company ''is not paying wages to its employees for time that the employees are not providing services,'' the guidance states, ''it may not treat any portion of the health plan expenses as qualified wages.'' In a letter to the I.R.S., Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Finance Committee chairman, along with others, said that finding runs counter to the clear intent that members of Congress had expressed in crafting the law. ''We urge you to reconsider this determination,'' the lawmakers wrote, ''in light of congressional intent and the importance of providing access to affordable health care during the ongoing health crisis.'' Technology Britain Tests App On Isle of Wight The Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast, is renowned for a beautiful coastline and balmy climate, drawing crowds of summer tourists from across Britain. And it is now at the forefront of national attention for a different reason: The British government is preparing to begin a trial there this week of a mobile app that will track the contacts of people infected with the coronavirus. The app uses Bluetooth to ''alert people if they have been near somebody who is later diagnosed with having coronavirus,'' Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Sunday. The tracking system will be rolled out by the National Health Service, and if the trials are successful, it will be available this month throughout the country. Antibody Testing F.D.A. Presses for Data On Accuracy of Results The Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that companies selling coronavirus antibody tests must submit data proving accuracy within the next 10 days or face removal from the market. The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been infected with the coronavirus, but results have been widely varied. Since mid-March, the agency has permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing evidence that they are accurate. The F.D.A.'s action follows a report by more than 50 scientists, which found that only three out of 14 antibody tests gave consistently reliable results, and even the best had flaws. An evaluation by the National Institutes of Health, working with other federal health agencies, has also found ''a concerning number'' of commercial tests that are performing poorly, the F.D.A. said. The agency has also been under fire from Congress, with numerous lawmakers raising questions about the validity of some of the tests. While 12 companies have been given F.D.A. clearance to sell the antibody tests, many other products do not have agency authorization. The result has been a confusing landscape in which tests by established companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Cellex and most recently, Roche Diagnostics, are competing with unapproved tests made by unknown companies and sold by U.S. distributors with spotty track records. The F.D.A. has blocked imports of some antibody tests at the U.S. border, and has ordered some distributors to revise claims about what individuals can learn from them, or halt sales.

33425,"WASHINGTON -- Two days after Democratic senators blocked it, the Senate voted on Thursday to take up legislation that would grant the president negotiating freedom to complete an expansive trade accord with 11 nations on the Pacific Rim, setting off a contentious congressional debate on one of President Obama's top priorities for his remaining time in office. While the motion to consider the legislation passed 65-33, that belied how hard the coming weeks will be for the White House. Most Democrats, including the top three Democratic leaders in the Senate, voted against even opening debate to give Mr. Obama so-called trade promotion authority. TD And before the vote, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, suggested that she could not accept a bill that would keep the door open to negotiate trade deals for three years, and possibly six, well into the next administration. ''While three years in the trade promotion authority bill may be appropriate for foreseeable trade agreements, there is unease with a process that would provide carte blanche for agreements unknown, for countries to be determined, for a time in perpetuity,'' she said. The stakes in the larger trade agreement are substantial for American business interests, including Boeing, Nike, the pharmaceutical industry, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Most corporate interests are strongly pushing for the Pacific Rim accord. Labor groups say it would cost Americans jobs and erode wages. The Senate reversed itself on the matter two hours after senators broadly approved legislation that would crack down on countries that manipulate their currency rates, putting bipartisan pressure on House leaders to take up a measure that Mr. Obama argues could scuttle the delicate Pacific trade talks. The trade votes on Thursday were starkly different from the first effort to take up the issue on Tuesday. Then, Senate Democrats united against even considering trade promotion authority, to provide for ''fast track'' approval of trade deals, defying their own president and holding out for assurances that tough enforcement provisions would be attached to that authority. What they got instead was a compromise to allow the currency provision to come to a vote in a separate bill that now faces an even steeper climb than the fast-track bill. Even if a bipartisan majority can pressure Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio to allow a House vote on the currency measure, the White House has expressed opposition. A formal White House statement of policy on Thursday, however, stopped short of a veto threat. But by separating the currency bill from the decision to proceed, Senate leaders moved closer to granting the president the authority he seeks. ''Under our plan, the Senate will avoid the poison pills that had been floated in favor of the very type of bipartisan approach we've been advocating for all along,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, said. ''It allows senators to express themselves without endangering more American trade jobs for the people we represent.'' The vote on Thursday to take up trade promotion authority begins a difficult process of securing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade deal in more than two decades. It would put countries from Canada to Chile, Japan to Australia -- while excluding China, at least for now -- under an economic umbrella representing 40 percent of the world's economy. Obama administration officials say an accord cannot be reached until Congress assures the White House and the other nations involved that any trade deal cannot be amended by lawmakers, though it could be rejected. Next week, senators will try to put new demands on those final negotiations. Senators Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, and Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, still want American negotiators to be required to include a chapter in the trade pact forbidding the intentional deflation of a country's currency to make its exports cheaper and United States exports more expensive. Mr. Portman, a trade representative in the George W. Bush administration, acknowledged the opposition of Republican leaders and the White House. ''It's wrongheaded,'' he said. ''I think they should be embracing this to get more support.'' The Senate voted 78-20 on a broad trade enforcement bill that included a crackdown on countries that manipulate their currency. The currency provision would require the Commerce Department to investigate claims by American companies that competitor nations are manipulating their currency to promote their own industries. And if manipulation is found, the government would have to impose tariffs to raise the cost of imports to compensate for the currency price imbalance. But the White House insists that a more diplomatic approach should be pursued. ''Those provisions would undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic questions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer,'' a White House statement released on Thursday said. Even supporters said that vote was intended more to allow lawmakers to express their frustration on the currency issue. The real showdown will be over the Portman-Stabenow amendment attached to the trade promotion authority itself. If that reached Mr. Obama's desk, supporters say, the president would have to sign it. ''That currency bill is going nowhere,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. ''Portman's the real deal. That's firing with real bullets.'' The trade enforcement legislation includes the creation of an interagency trade enforcement center and a system to respond faster to unfair trade practices, like the dumping of exports at prices below the cost of production. Another provision would require the Customs and Border Protection agency to expeditiously investigate allegations of customs duty evasion. Still another would close a 75-year-old loophole that allows the importation of goods produced with child labor if a company cannot find those goods elsewhere. The Senate separately approved an extension of an African trade preference law, 97-1, intended to expand economic ties with that continent. The House speaker, who has long been at odds with Mr. Obama, looks as of he intends to be a bulwark for the White House on this issue. ''We've had this discussion about currency between countries and continents for the 25 years that I've been here, and to think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday. Democrats and Republicans in both congressional chambers disagree. Ms. Stabenow took to the Senate floor to argue that Japan's weak yen is effectively raising the price of American automobiles there. ''Currency manipulation is the most significant 21st-century trade barrier that American businesses and workers face today, and it is the least enforced against,'' she said. Ms. Pelosi expressed her own frustration with the White House. ''The administration has been pretty clear that they don't want this in the bill,'' she said. ''We keep saying, 'Well, what other suggestions do you have?' '' ''There is a general belief,'' she added, ''that currency manipulation has been responsible for the loss of many jobs in this country.'' Such talk has administration officials worried and playing defense. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said Japan has refrained in recent years from the kind of blatant currency manipulation it practiced in the past. And China, which has closely managed its own currency, has let the renminbi rise against the dollar. The Obama administration is walking a tightrope. Congress could give Mr. Obama the authority he needs to conclude a Pacific trade agreement that he sees as a central element to enhance the administration's strategic role in Asia. But officials say that the demands imposed by Congress could scare off key partners such as Japan and Malaysia just as the deal comes into reach.

33426,"CITY COUNCIL meetings in Austin, Tex., tend to be droning, low-drama affairs, but that wasn't the case earlier this month when barbecue was on the agenda: specifically, the smell of barbecue and a proposal to control it, in response to some citizen complaints. The suggestion that a smell some would dab behind their ears if possible should be mitigated by special exhaust systems called smoke-scrubbers provoked local outrage, with opponents accusing the complainers of being from California (in Texas, that's not a compliment). TD But that's the thing about smells. One person's putrid is another person's pleasant, and local governments around the country are having a hard time regulating what's in the olfaction of the beholder. If you time-traveled back 200 years or so, you'd likely scrunch up your nose. Our forebears threw sewage out their windows, and the primary mode of transport -- horses -- relieved themselves all over the street. And let's not even discuss the pervasive smell of rotting food in the prerefrigeration era. These days there is a product called Poo-Pourri (toilet odor inhibitor), and people place their dogs' business in knotted plastic bags. Moreover, food that is mildly bruised, wilted or minutes past its sell-by date is dispatched to a landfill long before it can produce the slightest offending odor. ''We have so reduced the level of background odor pollution, we are becoming more sensitive to anything we smell,'' said Pamela Dalton, an olfactory researcher at Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit group in Philadelphia that studies smell and taste. Just 20 years ago, you might not have noticed someone smoking in the same restaurant where you were dining, whereas today you'd likely detect the residual odor of cigarette smoke on the clothes of someone simply walking past your table. Over the years attempts by states and municipalities to regulate odor have led to a patchwork of legal guidelines subjectively enforced by inspectors who sniff the air and determine whether to make a stink about a stink. In the past the offenders were typically livestock operations and wastewater treatment plants, but more recently odor inspectors are getting calls about smells emanating from ethnic restaurants, coffee roasters and candle and bath shops. In an effort to be more objective, a growing number of locales have begun using a device called a Nasal Ranger, which looks like a megaphone for the nose and measures the intensity of smells according to a so-called dilution ratio. An odor is considered intrusive if the average person can smell it when it is diluted with seven parts clean air -- a decades-old threshold of stinky, the origin of which no one I spoke to can quite recall. ''Unless we're talking a rendering facility or asphalt plant, it's rare to find anything that exceeds a seven to one ratio,'' said Ben Siller, a licensed smell investigator with the Denver office of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. His city's odor ordinance also considers it a violation if his department receives more than five complaints from different households about a smell within a 12-hour period. And that has been happening more often lately because of marijuana growing operations, recently made legal in the state. ''It has a strong musky, skunky odor when they are drying and curing the leaves,'' Mr. Siller said. ''But even that only registers two to one on the Nasal Ranger,'' which he added is the same ratio registered when his neighborhood bakery bakes cinnamon rolls, and ''I never get a call about that.'' That's because whether we like or dislike a smell depends primarily on the context and associations we have with it. Unlike other senses, smell has a direct and immediate link to the limbic system, the part of the brain that produces emotions. Thus, smelling something triggers overwhelmingly strong feelings before we are even consciously aware we smelled something. As Rudyard Kipling said, ''Smells are surer than sights or sounds to make your heart-strings crack.'' Which brings us back to the complaints about the barbecue smell in Austin. Although you might love the smell of slow-smoked brisket because of its association with satiation and good times with family and friends, you can come to hate it if you are forced to smell it when and where you don't want or expect to. ''The smell becomes highly offensive because of the distress of being exposed against your free will,'' said Rachel Herz, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Brown University and author of ''The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell.'' ''It's similar to your neighbor blaring a song you once liked loudly and constantly.'' A spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection said that of the more than 10,000 odor complaints that came in last year, many were from residents upset about cooking smells wafting into their apartments from restaurants and coffeehouses -- smells that might be pleasing when patronizing those same establishments. ''A lot of it has to do with tolerance level in neighborhoods that are getting gentrified,'' said Mr. Siller in Denver. ''People at lower socioeconomic levels may tolerate something much better than someone who moves into the same area and buys a house, sinks a fortune into remodeling and then goes out in the backyard and smells a pot grower, charbroiler, pet food manufacturer or something stinky like that.'' If a smell is part of a plume that contains particulates or other irritants, then it can cause inflammatory- and allergic-type reactions. But researchers said, for the most part, it's the stress of smelling something you don't want to that makes people feel sick. Physiological symptoms might include headaches, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure. Psychologically, it tends to make people feel depressed, anxious and irritable. Case law on odor liability is mixed, with courts sometimes finding in favor of plaintiffs (sniffers) and other times defendants (emitters), as well as ruling for and against insurance companies, which typically claim odors are pollution and thus not covered under many policies. Recent cases in Manhattan pitting apartment building residents against odoriferous downstairs restaurants have ended in undisclosed monetary settlements and improved ventilation systems. But there are also cases that went to trial, like that of Maxine Furs in Birmingham, Ala., which failed to recoup $350,000 in cleaning costs after its inventory was infused with the smell of curry from a neighboring Indian food restaurant. ''The smell of Indian food makes me sick now,'' said John Pechi, owner of Maxine Furs. While there are technologies to control and deodorize odorous emissions, they are often prohibitively expensive, particularly for small businesses. That's why Austin's City Council decided to study further the proposal that would require barbecue joints to install them. At Franklin Barbecue in Austin, where on a recent Saturday lines started forming at 9:30 a.m., the owner, Aaron Franklin, said the solution is for businesses to be good neighbors. ''Our smokers are on the second floor so the smell dissipates before it drifts down, and we make sure our fires have a complete combustion so you don't get that gross-smelling creosote,'' he said. ''And we make sure kids in the neighborhood get food for their birthday parties'' so the positive emotional associations with the smell of his barbecue get imprinted early.

33427,"BOSTON -- More than a few eyebrows will likely be raised on Thursday when the Italian architect Renzo Piano unveils his design for the expansion of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here. The cultural watchdogs of Boston don't take well to change. And the museum, whose collections haven't moved since 1924, is one of the most beloved art institutions in this city. Its eclectic array of artworks from the Middle Ages to the early-20th century, displayed in a dazzling faux-Venetian palazzo, stands alongside those in the Frick Collection in Manhattan and the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif., as a rare -- and intimate -- expression of a single collector's vision. TD Well, the preservationists should put away their torches and pitchforks. Mr. Piano's design, dominated by a four-story copper-clad volume that encloses a 300-seat music hall and a temporary-exhibitions gallery, keeps a respectful distance from the Venetian dowager. And the new building's strong geometric forms should make a welcome counterpoint to the old one, which, from the outside at least, has always seemed a bit bland. If the design has a flaw, it's not that it tramples all over Gardner's memory, but that it holds it in too high regard. Mr. Piano has been so careful to protect the sanctity of the existing museum in his design that you may find yourself tiptoeing through the galleries instead of floating joyously through them as visitors do today. I doubt Isabella Gardner ever walked around on tiptoe; she was more the type to dance barefoot to Gypsy tunes. Born into a newly rich New York family in 1840, she moved north 20 years later and became known in Boston society as something of an eccentric outsider. After her 1 1/2-year-old son died of pneumonia, she seemed to find solace in the world of musicians, artists and writers; John Singer Sargent and Henry James became friends. She had two qualities that are crucial to building a great collection: an all-consuming curiosity and confidence in her own tastes. She was among the first Americans to collect Renaissance painting, and when men wealthier than Gardner -- like Pierpont Morgan and Henry Clay Frick -- pushed her out of the market, she turned her astute eye to Spanish and Chinese art, amassing formidable collections there too. The museum she built, which opened in 1903, reflects the same independence of mind. Its galleries are centered around a fabulously faux-Venetian courtyard overflowing with tropical and flowering plants, both a reflection of Gardner's catholic tastes and an image of feminine power. A Roman mosaic of Medusa's head dominates the garden. Rows of mismatched Venetian windows -- some real, others fake -- line its pink walls. The barely disguised references to the female realm pile up as you climb to the upper floors. A somber marble staircase is decorated with an ornate wrought-iron railing made from the frame of a bed from an Italian convent. In one upstairs gallery a small, pious painting of Jesus' head, lightly bearing the weight of the cross, is set on a small table just to one side of a wild abduction scene, Titian's ''Europa.'' Underneath is a framed fabric swatch from one of Gardner's ballroom gowns. As splendid and theatrical as the museum is, however, it has suffered over the years. Immediately after Gardner's death the main entry was shifted so that it now lines up with a vaulted side gallery, which meant that visitors lost the impact of stepping from the dark, brick entry corridor directly into the light-filled courtyard. A small bookstore and cafe were stuffed into the back of the first floor in the 1970s. Conservation offices and a temporary gallery are in a small 1930s addition plugged into the back of the museum, an area staff members refer to (not, it seems, with affection) as the doghouse. Meanwhile the number of visitors has grown from a few thousand a year to nearly 200,000. The addition will clear up some of that mess. The bookstore and cafe will be moved to addition's ground floor, and the space at the back of the old museum will eventually return to its original function as a meditative space with Buddhas and Chinese screens. The new music hall means that the second-floor Tapestry Room, which is often used for recitals, can now be returned to its original state. The collections will be freer to breathe. But Mr. Piano has done more, striking an ideal balance between new and old without compromising the identity of either. The addition, whose copper cladding will give it a muscular feel, is set discreetly behind the existing building. A narrow garden, 50 feet wide, separates the two, creating a palpable tension, as between two magnets held slightly apart. That sense of tension is also apparent in the addition, in a constant play between darkness and light, gravity and weightlessness. The ground-floor lobby and commercial spaces will be wrapped entirely in glass, with the copper-clad gallery, music hall and offices resting above. These three spaces will be divided by vertical bands of glass, so that from certain angles they will seem to be breaking apart. (The gorgeousness of these forms may very well be diminished by the treatment of the copper surface; Mr. Piano plans to treat the copper with acid, which will give it a uniformly green finish, rather than letting it age naturally, which would convey a passing of time.) The sense of discrete spaces is enhanced by the treatment of the individual interiors, which feel less uniform in character than those in some of Mr. Piano's earlier museums. The music hall, surrounded by narrow balconies, may be one of his most radical spaces in years. The extreme vertical organization and compactness of the room bring to mind La Fenice in Venice. Because the rigidly symmetrical hall is a square, 44 feet on each side, audience members will be staring directly at one other as well as down toward the stage, an effect that could be pleasingly voyeuristic or distracting; it's hard to tell. For the gallery space Mr. Piano has created a mechanical ceiling that moves up and down so curators can make the room airier or more intimate, depending on the needs of a given show. A high window, facing northeast toward the old building, can be blocked out with a system of computerized shades. Behind the addition Mr. Piano has also designed a giant greenhouse with a sloping glass wall. Conceived as an Arcadia for visiting artists and scholars, it will include a row of apartments and terraces running along the top like little treehouses. Some people, no doubt, will complain that this expansion is yet another example of museum bloat. But my only worry about the design has to do with the way it leads you to the old building's galleries. When the project is complete, sometime in 2011, visitors will no longer be able to approach through the old entry on the Fenway. Instead they will enter the complex through Mr. Piano's new lobby, and from there turn right and follow a glass-enclosed walkway through the garden and into the back of Gardner's palazzo. This significantly lengthens the distance between entry and artworks, which I suspect is intentional. In recent years more and more architects have used an extended architectural narrative to screen out the visual noise of the contemporary city, and in the process prepare visitors mentally for the act of viewing art. But it may also further reduce the impact of Gardner's original vision. The ability to move, in a few short steps, from the darkness of the brick vaulted lobby to the joyous explosion of light that fills the towering pink courtyard is not just a great architectural effect; it is a powerful metaphor for what art can do -- and what it did for her. Mr. Piano has given us a thoughtful, mature, even beautiful, building. And there is no question in my mind that it is necessary. Still, some of us will mourn the loss of that experience.

On the land side, though, we have a solution so obvious and immediate that we usually miss it: high-speed rail. TD For example, numbers gleaned from the Port Authority's ''2006 Airport Traffic Report'' for greater New York indicate that nearly 20 percent of domestic flights from the three major airports fly to the 17 most traveled airports within 350 miles. This significant share does not even include the numerous commuter flights to and from lesser, nearby centers, travel that requires nearly as much airspace as is used by the larger planes. Even at only 150 miles per hour, a 350-mile railroad journey would take less time from door to door than an airplane ride, with greatly reduced stress, delay and cancellation. And let's not forget the comparative carbon footprint. George B. Terrien Rockland, Me., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your aptly titled editorial ''Dread of Flying'' points out that airline passengers ''do expect the term 'estimated time of arrival' to mean something.'' I've always felt that the term should be changed to WNAB: will not arrive before. It's about the only certainty in air travel these days. Marcia Thompson East Falmouth, Mass., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Air-travel delays and the demise of airline efficiency are indeed a product of ''out-of-control congestion,'' but the underlying cause is out-of-control competition. While the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act has benefited consumers in some cases with lower ticket prices, the industry clearly needs a more advanced, specific and supportive regulatory system rather than strictly competitive markets to improve operations. Most industry players, including our current government, bristle at mention of the ''R'' word (regulation), but it is helpful to keep in mind what regulation really is: a concept borrowed from nature that ensures a living thing can function reliably, adapt and grow. The industry requires smart regulation -- including more deliberate coordination between the public and private sectors -- to facilitate efficiency and modernization. That is the truest consumer benefit. Matt Andersson Chicago, Aug. 27, 2007 The writer is president of Indigo Aerospace, an aviation advisory company. To the Editor: Your editorial hits the nail on the head by identifying the trend to fly more smaller aircraft where fewer large aircraft used to go. What is needed at our most congested airports are high-occupancy aircraft (H.O.A.) periods. These would be the most high-demand, overscheduled periods at an airport. An aircraft not having a capacity of, arguably, 175 seats would not be allowed to operate on a designated H.O.A. runway during an H.O.A. period. Aircraft not meeting the minimum capacity would pay a large fine, which would help finance the air-traffic-control system. We do it with commuter lanes on our expressways, so why not do it on our nation's runways? William Maloney Aurora, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your editorial says there is an urgent need to remedy the delays and overcrowding at airports, and that the government should cap the number of aircraft that airports can handle. In the context of concern about global warming, the solution is to drastically cut the amount of aircraft travel. Air transport accounts for about 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, but high-flying airplanes leave contrails that are believed to cause two to four times more global warming than carbon dioxide emissions normally generate. Curtailing air travel these days sounds like a hardship, but in the 1950s we lived comfortably with a small fraction of today's air travel. John Burton Washington, N.J., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: It's not the lack of controlled airspace and the ability of the air-traffic-control system but the shortage of runways at our nation's major airports that is causing congestion and delays. The Federal Aviation Administration has the capacity to handle the number of commercial and private jets that crisscross the nation each day. It just doesn't have the concrete to put the jets on when they arrive or depart from most of our airports. Unfortunately, it's a situation that is not easily resolved because of insufficient real estate and environmental issues that arise when airport expansions are put on the table. It's a chicken-and-egg situation that must be solved to meet the growing needs of America's traveling public. Alfred S. Newman Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: While you accurately report a 24 percent increase in traffic in and out of Kennedy Airport since October, another statistic should be included: the 27 percent drop in the number of certified professional controllers at the airport. In 2004, Kennedy had 37 controllers; today there are 27. By the end of next summer there will be 21, all responsible for the predicted 1,500 aircraft landings and takeoffs a day. This staffing profile is found at almost every air-traffic-control facility in the United States as staffing continues to drop while volume increases, creating lower safety margins. While safety will always be a controller's No. 1 priority, we are being put into positions where chances for mistakes are greatly increased. The decreasing number of controllers will go on as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues its oppressive jailhouselike working conditions. Stephen J. Abraham Mamaroneck, N.Y., Aug. 28, 2007 The writer is a National Air Traffic Controllers Association representative at Kennedy Airport. DRAWING (DRAWING BY PETER HAMLIN) IN",[],perso
33429,"WASHINGTON, March 15 -- Senator John Kerry has conspicuously avoided speaking out on the terrorist attacks in Spain and the fall of the government there, a departure from his practice of trying to use the events of the day to bolster his case against President Bush.   All year, Mr. Kerry has argued that the war in Iraq has diverted resources and attention away from what should have been devoted to a more pernicious target, terrorist groups, and he has accused the president of squandering alliances that previous administrations carefully cultivated.   TD Yet in a 25-minute speech on Monday about terrorism and domestic security to the International Association of Firefighters, the senator mentioned the events in Spain only in passing. He accused the president of being ''short on action'' in protecting Americans against terrorism and added, ''As we saw again last week in Spain, real action is what we need.''   Democrats inside and outside Mr. Kerry's campaign said on Monday that the situation in Spain now was too uncertain and delicate to use politically.   The Kerry campaign said the senator had no plans to delve into Spain, even though he planned to make a big speech on national security on Wednesday.   One Democrat, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who dropped out of the presidential race last year, explained why Mr. Kerry might think it unwise to try to make political hay out of the tragedy.   ''First,'' Mr. Graham said, ''we don't know enough of what happened in Spain to develop a final conclusion.   ''Second, I don't think any American politician can run for president on a platform that they hope bad things happen to the people of America, and some might interpret an evaluation of the Spain tragedy on the campaign trail as a statement that we're next.''   Other Democratic politicians said American voters did not have to be told directly that the bombings in Spain showed that Mr. Bush had failed to stamp out terrorism.   For Mr. Kerry, said former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a friend and supporter of his onetime colleague and now president of New School University, ''there is an opportunity, but you've got to grieve the death, you've got to feel the tragedy, or there's no chance of getting public opinion on your side.''   At the White House, Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman, was asked repeatedly on Monday whether the administration thought the attacks in Spain had been intended to affect the outcome of the election there, whether the administration was concerned that the terrorists had prevailed and whether the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq would pose a problem.   Mr. McClellan dodged the questions. This was a typical answer: ''I think there's going to, obviously, be a lot of political analysis done on the election. Let me tell you what I know, and that is that terrorists are indiscriminate. They are indiscriminate in who they attack and when they attack. Terrorists have attacked civilians in Indonesia, they've attacked civilians in Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and a number of other places. Terrorists want to spread fear and chaos. They want to intimidate. That is why they attack innocent men, women and children. They have no regard for innocent life.''   But if the White House seemed defensive, Democratic politicians basically steered clear of the issue.   ''We're all sick to our stomachs that Al Qaeda seems to have scored a victory,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''After a real tragedy happens, you don't want to talk about it right away.''   Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Kerry early in the campaign before signing on with Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said, ''When an appropriate time has passed, I certainly think you can make what happened in Spain an issue.''   But now, Mr. Lehane continued, ''I think you just have to be very careful about not looking like you are trying to score political points when there are literally funerals going on.''   One of the few exceptions to the rule of silence was the response of Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who has few delegates but has not folded his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He issued a statement saying the events demonstrated that ''the invasion of Iraq has made us all less safe.''   Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said any linking of the terrorism in Spain with domestic politics would make politicians sound as if they were saying, ''I told you so.''   Leon E. Panetta, a former Democratic congressman from California who was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, said, ''The smart thing from my own experience is that when there's a highly charged emotional event in the world, you're better off letting that event play out by itself rather than engaging it politically.   ''Otherwise, you might pay a heavy price because you don't know how it's going to turn out.''

33334,"HOLLAND, Pa. -- The Tea Party movement ignited a year ago, fueled by anti-establishment anger. Now, Tea Party activists are trying to take over the establishment, ground up. Across the country, they are signing up to be Republican precinct leaders, a position so low-level that it often remains vacant, but which comes with the ability to vote for the party executives who endorse candidates, approve platforms and decide where the party spends money. TD A new group called the National Precinct Alliance says it has a coordinator in nearly every state to recruit Tea Party activists to fill the positions and has already swelled the number of like-minded members in Republican Party committees in Arizona and Nevada. Its mantra is this: take the precinct, take the state, take the party -- and force it to nominate conservatives rather than people they see as liberals in Republican clothing. Here, in a perennial battleground district outside Philadelphia, Tea Party activists are trying to strip the local committee of its influence in choosing the Republican nominee to run against Representative Patrick J. Murphy, a Democrat who won the seat in 2006 by about 1,500 votes. After the local party said it would stick to its custom of endorsing a candidate rather than holding an open primary, Tea Party groups decided to hold their own candidate forum where people could cast a ballot. If the party does not yield, the groups say they will host a debate, too. ''We kind of changed the rules,'' said Anastasia Przybylski, one of the organizers. The Tea Party movement, named the original tax revolt in 1773, might be better described as a diverse, rambunctious and Internet-connected network of groups, powered by grass-roots anxiety about the economy, bailouts and increasing government involvement in health care. At one extreme are militia members who have shown up at meetings wearing guns and suggesting that institutions like the Federal Reserve be eliminated. At the other are those like Ms. Przybylski, who describes herself as ''just a stay-at-home mom'' who became agitated about the federal stimulus package. And if the Democrats are big-government socialists, the Republicans, in the Tea Party mind, are enablers. In some recent polls, a hypothetical Tea Party wins more support than Democrats or Republicans, and the most anti-establishment Tea Party activists push to fight as a third party. But as the movement looks toward the midterm elections in November, a growing number of activists argue that the best way to translate anger into influence is to infiltrate the Republican establishment (Democrats being, for the average Tea Partier, beyond redemption). ''If you want to have revenge against the Republican Party for using you for so many years, the best way is to turn around and use the Republican Party to your advantage,'' said Eric Odom, a Tea Party activist in Chicago who recently started a political action committee, and on his blog urged Tea Partiers to stop complaining about the Republican Party and ''move in and take it over.'' Republican leaders have been trying to harness the Tea Party energy -- Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, recently called the Tea Parties ''a revelatory moment.'' ''It puts in stark relief where the American people are, how they feel and what they feel,'' Mr. Steele said. ''It's important for our party to appreciate and understand that so we can move toward it, and embrace it.'' Not all Republicans agree. Some say the party needs to broaden its reach, not cater to the fringe. The defining experience for many Tea Party groups was the special election in the 23rd Congressional District of New York in November, where party leaders chose a candidate whom conservatives viewed as a Republican in name only -- she supported same-sex marriage, abortion rights and the federal stimulus package. After activists flooded the district to support a conservative third-party candidate, the Republican dropped out and endorsed the Democrat, who won. Conservatives took the Republican retreat as a victory, but also saw the power of the party structure in deciding who the candidates will be. The rallying cry for more local involvement has been ''No more NY-23's.'' ''We don't want to see what happened in New York happen here,'' Ms. Przybylski said. The forum here drew nine candidates and a standing-room crowd in an auditorium built for 1,200. The questions organizers had drawn up for the candidates hinted at the issues important to so called Teapublicans. Will you pledge to vote against tax increases, even hidden taxes like those in health care reform? Should corporate executives who encourage illegal immigrants to stay because it is good for business be hauled off to jail? Do you believe manmade pollution is a significant contributor to global warming? (''I don't necessarily think there's been global warming,'' one candidate objected.) Each was asked to define the 10th Amendment, and to cite examples of where it ''might have been violated.'' ''It's my favorite amendment in the Constitution,'' exclaimed one candidate, Ira Hoffman. ''I can't believe it!'' The amendment declares that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people, and Tea Party activists hold that Congress has overstepped its bounds, particularly by legislating health care. So candidates were asked whether they would support efforts to nullify the health care bill? Finally, the moderator asked them if 2010 would be ''the year of the Tea Party.'' The candidates, and many in the audience, said it would, but only if the Tea Party advocates worked the system. ''I think we can do greater things working in a system that's established than we ever can being a bunch of anarchists,'' said Jennifer Turner Stefano, a vice president of a local Tea Party group who is contesting her local Republican committeeperson. Ms. Stefano, a stay-at-home mother and former television reporter, will have to get 10 signatures and put her name on the ballot to run. But the National Precinct Alliance estimates that about 60 percent of the roughly 150,000 local Republican committee seats are vacant and can be filled by essentially showing up. ''Even if you've got a slight majority, you just need maybe 26 states, then you can have your say in how the party goes,'' said Philip Glass, a former commercial mortgage banker in Cincinnati who is the national director of the precinct alliance. The precinct strategy, like the Tea Party movement itself, has spread via the Internet, on sites like Resistnet.com. A National Tea Party Convention in Nashville next month will feature seminars on how to take over starting at the precinct level. Advocates hold up the example of Las Vegas, where a group of about 30 people who had become friendly at Tea Party events last spring met to discuss how they could turn their crowds into political influence. One mentioned that there were about 500 open precinct committee positions in the local Republican Party. They recruited other activists and flooded the committee -- the Republican Party says it now has 780 committee people, up from about 300. In July, they approved a new executive committee, and Tony Warren, one of the organizers and a new precinct committeeman himself, said six out of seven executives are ''constitutional conservatives,'' in keeping with Tea Party ideology. With the bulk of Nevada's population in the Las Vegas area, the local committee was able to elect a conservative slate to the state party in December, including a state chairman who has said he wants to make the party ''safe'' for conservatives. As recently as last spring, Mr. Warren said, ''we didn't even know how the darn party worked.'' PHOTOS: The audience, top, at a forum held by Tea Party groups in Holland, Pa.

33335,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 -- President Bush delivered two competing messages to Americans today as he encouraged them to go to ballgames and get on airplanes but at the same time declared that the country was at risk.   ''Our nation is still in danger,'' Mr. Bush said at a White House reception as he announced a fourth case of anthrax, this one in New York City. ''But the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''  TD  Seconds later, Mr. Bush exhorted Americans to go about their lives.   ''We cannot let the terrorists lock our country down,'' he said. ''We can't let terrorists, a few evildoers, hold us hostage.'' Americans, he said, need to fight terrorism ''by going to work, going to ballgames, getting on airplanes, singing with joy and strength.''   The dueling messages of reassurance and warning echoed the themes of the president's prime-time news conference on Thursday night and presented a growing challenge, Republicans say, for Mr. Bush not to confuse or frighten Americans. But the consensus among the professionals who help fashion presidential images is that Mr. Bush is on track, for now. His message, they say, is simple: Go out, but be careful. America has changed.   ''I think that's the reality, and I think we're going to be bounced back and forth and up and down for a long time to come,'' said Michael K. Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image consultant who has advised the current White House. ''I think he's done a pretty good job of trying to balance that role of counselor or calmer along with his role as commander in chief.''   Mr. Deaver added: ''Everything I've seen, just in my own experience, tells me that people are hanging on to the government for the first time in a long time. This is when Washington is important. I hope he understands that we need constant reassurance. It's topic A, and it really is based on fear. I think he senses that, and so he is out there much more than normal.''   So far Mr. Bush has not crystallized his message of reassurance and warning into a succinct sound bite, but has veered back and forth, depending on the day or event. Two weeks ago in Chicago, when he announced new security measures at the nation's airports, Mr. Bush seemed to become the national travel director, urging Americans to fly again.   But in announcing the new case of anthrax today with jarring words in the middle of an East Room celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month that included the singer Gloria Estefan,  Mr. Bush was once again the bearer of alarming news.   The case of anthrax, he said, ''has got to cause concern for our nation.'' Mr. Bush then reported that the victim was ''doing well'' and that she ''obviously didn't ingest enough to cause death, thank God.'' He also said that ''I want everybody in the country to know we're responding rapidly'' and added that ''the government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry.''   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster, said that so far Americans seemed to understand the simultaneous warnings of danger and cheerful proddings to live again. ''I think people recognize that both of these things are true,'' he said. ''We haven't had foreigners killing Americans here since I guess the War of 1812, and we've always had this notion that these two big oceans have kept us protected. Over the longer term we are now going to have to live with this risk, and at the same time not let it change us.''   Mr. Teeter cited bombings in London and terrorism in other countries in Europe as a model, however distressing, for how Americans can adjust to an undercurrent of fear in their lives.   ''It's clear that democracies and relatively open societies can learn to live with it,'' Mr. Teeter said. ''But I think it will be an adjustment and change for this country.''   Mr. Bush and the White House have sought to harness some of that fear by asking each child in America to donate a dollar to Afghan children. Today Mr. Bush said the inspiration for his campaign came from the March of Dimes, which began nearly 64 years ago based on another fear, polio. Over four months in 1938, he said, Americans sent 2.6 million dimes to the White House of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who himself had the disease.   ''Late in life, Eleanor Roosevelt asked what her husband had learned from the experience of polio,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech today to a March of Dimes conference at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ''She said that Franklin had gained strength and courage he had not before.''   Noting that a dollar today is roughly equivalent to a dime in the late 1930's, Mr. Bush, at that moment the reassurer, concluded: ''We all need to have a bit of Franklin Roosevelt in us today.''

33336,"AS oil and gasoline prices rise, political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve is building, including among some in Congress. The global oil market is fundamentally strained and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems. Yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses. Instead it should be preserved to address an emergency disruption in supply. TD While no one can confidently predict the global oil market, arguments that prices will remain high throughout the year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative. Global supplies are tight, and the hope for an improving global economy will only increase demand. Historically, Saudi Arabia has maintained a cushion of spare production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply. This spare capacity has played a critical role in calming the market when instability threatens oil-producing nations. That spare capacity is now likely to be only 3 percent, which will make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to increase production on short notice. The past year of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has not resulted in any major supply disruptions, but roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in Sudan, Yemen and Syria, and the growing impact of United States and European sanctions on Iranian production. If successful, President Obama's recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on Iran and strain global oil markets further. Indeed, increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is good news in the effort to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capability. Iran's total production is now about 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 2 million barrels per day are exported. The United States Energy Information Administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this summer could cut demand for Iranian oil exports in half. This combination of circumstances, however, does not yet constitute a severe supply disruption. Using the reserve now would be premature, reduce our national security options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets. Since its inception in 1975, the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances. There have been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions, including test sales, exchanges to address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise $220 million to balance the federal budget. The oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions -- during the first Iraq war, after Hurricane Katrina, and last year, when President Obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil during that country's civil war. In each instance, the releases were coordinated internationally, through the International Energy Agency, with some oil offered by the European Union, the United States and other non-OPEC nations. Each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances. While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances, the president and Congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of $100-a-barrel oil and $4-a-gallon gasoline. Despite the traditional election-year rancor, there is actually considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done. Increasing domestic oil production is extremely important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit. The United States is the third largest oil producer in the world and United States production must continue to play a critical role in meeting global demand. That production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by 2020. If this increase is achieved, the American contribution to the global market will push down global prices and could enable some increase in global spare capacity. The Obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production. However, no amount of production can insulate the United States from the global market and global price spikes. The ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use compared to the size of our economy. In 1975, our economy used 1.2 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of gross domestic product (2005 dollars); in 2010, we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of G.D.P. This reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel economy. A diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of Congress. While it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades, there is considerable support in both parties for efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels, electric and natural gas vehicles. All of these actions will continue to increase the oil-efficiency and resiliency of the United States economy. For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets.

33337,"Caucusgoers, uniquely, will declare their loyalty before their friends and neighbors. And they are taking their responsibility very seriously. CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- It is a public display of civic duty unique in American politics: Iowans on Monday night will stand in front of their neighbors and express their preference for a candidate for president. No curtains covering a voting machine. No private paper ballots. Just a declaration of loyalty before fellow Democrats. TD The Iowa caucuses are at once both quaint and globally significant, with a singular power to elevate, or deflate, candidacies. But for all of their idiosyncrasies, perhaps their most distinctive element is the sheer transparency they provide to the selection process. At a time of such political polarization, underpinned by anxiety among Iowa Democrats that they will elevate a nominee unable to defeat President Trump, the public nature of the caucuses has amplified the stakes. In interviews with scores of Iowans over the last three months, many expressed ambivalence about making a choice, desperately trying to assess what kind of candidate others might want to elect. Many appeared wary of picking sides, and risking fragmentation, at the expense of presenting a united front; they vowed to support the eventual nominee no matter what. Some caucusgoers said, tellingly, that they were eager to knock doors for candidates they supported but preferred to do so in nearby towns or counties lest they alienate their neighbors. ''The idea is that the caucuses are this very romantic Jeffersonian thing, with neighbors gathering in small groups to discuss ideas and candidates, and help choose leadership that will organize volunteers and lead us to electoral victory,'' said Nathan Thompson, the Democratic chairman in Winneshiek County. ''Well, in reality, it can be a very frustrating and divisive thing for all of these volunteers and attendees.'' It is another complicating factor in a race full of them. Even elected officials are trying to divine the best approach. Rob Sand, the state auditor and a rising star in the Democratic Party, said he planned to caucus for ''uncommitted,'' a category for those who do not want to align themselves with a candidate. Or he may not caucus at all. ''Ultimately, many of us will have a nominee who was not our first choice -- we are going to have to put that aside and do our duty to help that nominee win,'' Mr. Sand said. ''So, I'm planning to set aside my own ability to make a choice to be a voice for unity.'' As the caucuses loom, Iowa Democrats are preparing to make what may be their most significant decision ever, one that could set the party on a path to ousting Mr. Trump from the White House or divide it further. And rarely has the outcome of the caucuses been so difficult to predict or so highly anticipated. ''Anything can happen here,'' said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. ''There's growing clarity -- but there's not a lot of clarity.'' Adding to the sense of uncertainty, both the progressive and moderate wings of the party have taken turns asserting their dominance. All four of the leading candidates -- Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., -- have led polls here in recent months. Another challenger, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has edged closer but not yet close enough. Most recently, Mr. Sanders has appeared to open up a lead in Iowa, consolidating liberal backing as more moderate candidates in the race continue to split their support. A nascent attempt by moderate Democrats at thwarting his rise before it is too late has shown signs of backfiring. Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $1 million off a negative ad last week that targeted him by name. Iowa is already on tenterhooks. For months, it has defended itself against criticism that it is too white, its caucuses too exclusionary, to have the privilege of being the first state in the nominating process. Candidates have questioned the state's leadoff position in the calendar. Across the state, Iowans are wary that the absence of a clean victory could muddle the choice for Democrats in other states and undermine Iowa's claim to serving as a springboard to the nomination. ''I do think the Iowa caucuses might come to an end, especially if the results are indecisive,'' said John Grennan, the Democratic chairman in Poweshiek County. ''2016 was very messy. 2020 could be, too.'' Yet the race's prevailing uncertainty has not stopped strategists, campaign aides and caucusgoers from prognosticating that has grown more frenetic as the Iowa contest approaches. It is a parlor game that has been rendered even more difficult by a complex new set of caucus rules. For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will report, on a rolling basis, three numbers on caucus night -- a delegate count and the amount of support on both the first and second rounds, known as alignments -- leaving open the possibility that more than one candidate could claim victory. What if Mr. Sanders receives the most support on the first alignment but another candidate wins on the delegate count? What if the top candidates are clustered together, separated by only a few percentage points? Such inconclusive results would make it difficult for any candidate to ride unrivaled momentum into New Hampshire one week later. And should voters remain as undecided in New Hampshire as in Iowa, Democrats could be staring at an extended primary fight that could leave everyone bruised. For Democrats hoping for a clearer picture after Monday's caucuses, it could lead to more hand-wringing and division. Candidates have already begun attacking their rivals in a bid for dominance. Some campaigns have provided clues as to how they will assess the results on caucus night. Senior advisers to Mr. Sanders have indicated the Sanders campaign will declare victory if Mr. Sanders gets the most support on the first alignment. Aides to Mr. Buttigieg, on the other hand, are focusing on the delegate count. The Iowa Democratic Party and other party officials have encouraged the news media to report the delegate count, as has traditionally been done. With so many undecided caucusgoers, the results could come down to how well organized campaigns are, particularly at the precinct level, where the final persuading will take place. Some campaigns have put in place precinct teams to persuade and wrangle caucusgoers before and after the first alignment. Precinct captains will be in touch constantly with their campaign headquarters for directives on their strategy inside the room. Among caucusgoers, the persistent discussion of statewide political angst has only produced more angst. The degree of uncertainty, lingering even at this final stage of the precaucus season, has confounded some Democratic officials. ''Most people are undecided, and not only are they undecided but they're considering staying undecided on caucus night,'' said Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats. ''Considering the sheer number of candidates and length of the campaign season, I didn't think we would be in this position so close.'' Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Reid Epstein from Coralville, Iowa.

33339,"CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 29 -- Opponents of President Hugo Chavez stepped up preparations today for a general strike next week, heading toward another bruising confrontation with the government.   An anti-Chavez business leader, Carlos Fernandez, said the strike would start early Monday. The other main organizer, Carlos Ortega, a union leader, said, ''The situation is unsustainable.''  TD  As political tensions mounted before the strike, debate raged over a decision by the nation's electoral authorities to call a referendum for Feb. 2 on Mr. Chavez's presidency. The government, backed by a Supreme Court ruling that appeared to contradict the National Election Council decision on Thursday, rejected the referendum as illegal and unconstitutional.   But the electoral body said today that the referendum requested by the opposition was valid and should go ahead.   Mr. Chavez, the former paratrooper who was elected in 1998 and survived a brief coup in April, says the country's Constitution only allows for a binding referendum on his presidency in August, halfway through the term.

33340,"WASHINGTON -- Leading Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday reacted skeptically to the idea of overhauling surveillance laws to make it easier to wiretap people who communicate online rather than by telephone, a major priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawmakers expressed their concerns at a House hearing devoted to a problem that law enforcement officials call ''going dark'' -- investigators' inability to carry out court-approved wiretap orders when the people who are the targets communicate using services that lack a surveillance capability. TD The F.B.I. has been quietly laying the groundwork for years for a push to require Internet-based communications services -- like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerry and Skype -- to design their systems with a built-in way to comply with wiretap orders. On Thursday, the bureau made its first full airing of the ''going dark'' problem. ''Due to the revolutionary expansion of communications technology in recent years, the government finds that it is rapidly losing ground in its ability to execute court orders with respect to Internet-based communications,'' said the F.B.I.'s general counsel, Valerie Caproni. A 1994 law requires phone companies to build their networks with the capability of immediately starting to intercept a user's communications when the company is presented with a wiretap order. But that law does not cover Internet-based communication providers. As a result, while they, too, are subject to court wiretap orders, they are often unable to comply, for technical reasons, when presented with one. Ms. Caproni stopped short of making any specific legislative proposal, saying that the Obama administration was still debating the issue internally. Last fall, The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials were developing a bill that would impose new regulations on Internet communications companies and phone and broadband carriers, making them easier to wiretap. ''We don't have a specific request yet,'' Ms. Caproni said. ''The administration does not yet have a proposal. It is something that is actively being discussed within the administration, and I am optimistic that we will have a proposal in the near future.'' Still, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, was one of several lawmakers who said he was likely to greet such a proposal with skepticism. Forcing Internet communications services to build in ''back doors'' for law enforcement surveillance, he said, would hamper innovation and create vulnerabilities for hackers and foreign governments to exploit. ''Requiring back doors in all communications systems by law runs counter to how the Internet works and may make it impossible for some companies to offer their services,'' Mr. Conyers said. Several lawmakers of both parties raised concerns about how such a mandate would affect the competitiveness of Internet companies that operate in the United States. Still, several Republicans suggested sympathy with law enforcement officials' fear that changing technology could hamper their ability to investigate criminals and terrorists. Ms. Caproni emphasized that the F.B.I. was not seeking new surveillance powers, but rather a way to keep its existing powers from eroding. She also said the F.B.I. was not seeking a decryption key that would allow the government to directly intercept and unscramble secure communications. Rather, she said, the bureau hoped to require communication service providers to deploy, within their own systems, a wiretapping capability. The provider would have to be able to isolate, intercept and deliver to the government a particular user's communications in response to a wiretap order. Susan Landau, a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study fellow and former Sun Microsystems engineer, argued against building interception systems within a service, citing high-profile cases in which hackers exploited such mechanisms in Greece and Italy to illegally spy on politicians and other prominent people. Ms. Caproni spoke with caution about several aspects of the F.B.I.'s broad goals that have attracted controversy. For example, law enforcement officials have said in the past that all companies that facilitate communications should be able to provide a plain-text version of messages in response to a wiretap order. Such a mandate could require major changes for companies like Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry Enterprise Server system relays encrypted messages that the company says it cannot unscramble. Last year, Research in Motion came into conflict with several governments, including in India and the United Arab Emirates, over their inability to conduct surveillance of messages sent via its encrypted service. Asked about encryption, Ms. Caproni said that if a provider encrypted communications but had the ability to decrypt them, then it should be required to give law enforcement unscrambled versions. And she said that if an individual encrypted his own communications, investigators would have to find some other way to monitor that person. But crucially, she did not directly address whether a service provider should be allowed to encrypt a user's communications in such a way that the provider is unable to unscramble them -- even if a court orders it to do so. The hearing came a day after the release of several hundred pages of internal F.B.I. documents showing that the bureau has been working with great urgency to push to change legislation for years. The documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group. The documents shed new light on how the F.B.I.'s interest in the ''going dark'' problem predates the Obama administration. The bureau commissioned a study from the RAND Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton several years ago, and it conducted surveys of law enforcement officials seeking examples of encountering obstacles to carrying out wiretap orders. One such document redacted a legislative proposal for the ''going dark'' surveillance issue. But beneath it, a related proposal was left uncensored: electronic communications service providers, it said, should be required ''to retain for two years records showing the origination and termination of communications.'' Currently, law enforcement agencies are able to obtain such records only if the provider has chosen to preserve them for its own purposes, like billing.

33341,"WASHINGTON -- George W. Bush has just placed his faith in Saddam Hussein's reliability. If the Iraqi tyrant remains true to form -- again misreading America's once-in-a-decade resolve -- Bush's recently evolved Four Resolution Strategy will bring about his overthrow.   Resolution No. 1 is to come from the U.S. Congress. In mid-October, after a debate between ''Here's the case'' Republicans and ''What was that case again?'' Democrats, Congress will pass a resolution containing the big After: after the U.N. Security Council has made a final effort to insert unfetterable inspectors, and that fails, then the president will be authorized to enforce the terms of the 1991 surrender. But come back again after the election before you bomb anybody.  TD  Resolution No. 2 comes from the U.N.: Submit to intrusive inspections or we may not be able to restrain those bellicose Americans. This is your last chance; this time we mean it.   Resolution No. 3 comes from the Congress, after Saddam has allowed U.N. inspectors in and again begun haggling over where they can go and when. The gist: O.K., Mr. President, you can commence firing, but you'd better have U.N. permission, allies with you and an Iraqi George Washington in the wings.   Resolution No. 4, again from the U.N.: This time, we really really mean it. If you don't cut out the rope-a-dope, we'll pull our frustrated inspectors out next week, lest they be hit by bombers from inpatient member nations. And you'd better not hold our people hostage or there'll be war-crime trials for all officers over the rank of lieutenant.   I deduce this possible drawn-out scenario from a single letter of a single word in President Bush's speech: U.N. resolutions, plural. By mollifying the Baker-Scowcroft-Hagel set, which reflects his father's views, the president has promised to go one U.N. resolution too far.   The other indication of a four-resolution fallback comes from last weekend's reactions of presidential hopefuls. On the Senate Democratic spectrum from hawkish Lieberman-Edwards to dovish Daschle-Kerry, the message has gone forth: We're going to have to vote on this before the election, so let's engage the White House in drawing up a resolution before the election that we can back out of in another resolution afterward.   That's because the original Democratic position -- let's not vote before the election lest the voters' jingoistic views affect our decision -- was untenable. No governmental decision is more important than going to war to prevent an attack, and voters have a right and an obligation to find out where their representatives stand.   In the same way, President Bush had to abandon the notion that all he had to do was ''consult'' with Congressional leaders. He needs Congressional authorization to wage war, just as Congress needs to make its views known by a difficult vote in a timely fashion. Such mutual deference between branches is essential.   Bush softened his position substantially by deferring to the U.N. as well. He covered that softening with tough words clearly implying ''or else,'' and reminding the U.N. of its vulnerability by raising the specter of the feckless League of Nations. His hard words to cloak accommodation fooled no national leaders, but gave Russia and France cover to protect their interests after the U.S. deposes their debtor and customer in Baghdad.   But the quadruple-ultimata strategy adopted by Bush, while it wins praise for uncowboyesque caution from multilateralist media and relieved U.N. officials, depends entirely on the dependability of Saddam.   For this approach to succeed in overthrowing the dangerous dictatorship, the White House is relying on Baghdad to show not merely consistency in recalcitrance, but an insufferable, infuriating intractability in intransigence. Bush is betting that Saddam will (a) reject the U.N resolutions as humiliating or (b) accept the final-final warning and then negotiate endlessly with the inspectors so as to make their mission impossible.   The basis for this gamble is Bush's certainty, based on the logical extrapolation of past and present intelligence reports, that Saddam has evidence of mass-murder weaponry to hide. The Iraqi dictator cannot accede to coercive inspection, enforced by U.N. troops, without blowing up what has cost him more than $100 billion in a decade's oil revenues to build.   That would not be like Saddam. And on that presumed defiance rests Bush's diplomatic strategy.

33342,"WASHINGTON, March 26 -- The World Trade Organization ruled today that the steel tariffs imposed by President Bush last year were illegal.   The administration said it would appeal the decision.  TD  While the trade decision was called interim, with the final report expected next month, it is rare for an interim decision to be reversed. If the United States loses next month, European and other nations could impose trade sanctions of comparable value against the United States.   Last spring, Mr. Bush imposed tariffs of nearly 30 percent on most types of steel imported from Europe, Asia and South America, the biggest government action to protect an industry in several decades. While it was praised by the steel industry and trade unionists, the move was criticized by free trade advocates and companies that use steel in manufacturing.   The case against the tariffs was brought by the European Union, which accused the United States of illegally protecting the steel industry. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, called the tariffs ''unjustified, highly protectionist U.S. measures.''   ''I am in no doubt that the U.S. will lose this case, as it has lost all six previous safeguard cases,'' Mr. Lamy said when the initial case was brought against the United States.   But there was no celebratory statement or any comment from the Europeans today. All spokesmen said they would not discuss an interim decision, but foreign officials also said Europe wanted to avoid creating a further division with the United States in a time of war.   Today's ruling, which was not a surprise, was the second major loss for the United States at the W.T.O. in the last year. The trade panel awarded Europe the right to impose $4 billion worth of trade sanctions against the United States for giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations.   When administration officials imposed the steel tariffs they said they were legal under provisions in the world trading rules allowing a response to a surge of steel imports.   The tariffs were meant to help the American steel industry find its footing in the global market. American trade officials said today that the strategy worked.   ''The domestic steel industry has undergone an unprecedented level of consolidation and restructuring over the last year that have made it more competitive,'' said one American trade official, who insisted on not being identified.   Democratic lawmakers criticized the trade decision, citing a United States International Trade Commission study done before the tariffs were imposed that showed imports were seriously injuring important parts of the American steel industry. They said the W.T.O. had exceeded its authority.   ''I support the goal of an international trading system,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ''But we have a growing problem with dispute settlement decisions that are inventing obligations and requirements to which the United States and other countries never agreed. Ultimately, these types of decisions will only undermine confidence in the W.T.O.''   Some Democrats said the administration was partly to blame for failing to adopt an aggressive strategy to end a series of rulings against the United States.   Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, accused the administration of overseeing the loss of 13 of 15 cases brought against the United States since 2001.   ''This decision furthers a trend that jeopardizes the credibility of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement system and must serve as a wake-up call for the administration,'' Mr. Levin said.   In Congressional hearings today, steel officials and union representatives praised the tariffs. Leo W. Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers of America, told lawmakers that they should not forget the history that led to the president's decision to impose the steel tariffs. For several years, he said, the domestic steel industry was ''under attack from foreign producers, aided and abetted by foreign governments through subsidies and other market manipulations.''   ''The consequences of this assault have been disastrous for our steelworkers and for the American steel industry,'' Mr. Gerard said.   The result, he said, was that 37 companies were forced into bankruptcy, 54,000 steel workers lost their jobs, and pension plans and health care programs were being scaled back for retirees, widows and other dependents.   But some manufacturers have complained that the tariffs have led to higher prices for steel and hurt their companies.   Wes Smith, the president of the E&E Manufacturing Company, with 250 employees in Plymouth, Mich., testified that the tariffs and rising cost of steel amounted to a new tax for him.   ''We are willing to meet the challenge of competing with the Asians,'' Mr. Smith said. ''However, we cannot do that with our hands tied behind our backs by having our government tax our largest input by 30 percent.''

33343,"If you listened to the Republican candidates this year, you heard a conventional set of arguments. But if you go online, you can find a vibrant and increasingly influential center-right conversation. Most of the young writers and bloggers in this conversation intermingle, but they can be grouped, for clarity's sake, around a few hot spots: Paleoconservatives. The American Conservative has become one of the more dynamic spots on the political Web. Writers like Rod Dreher and Daniel Larison tend to be suspicious of bigness: big corporations, big government, a big military, concentrated power and concentrated wealth. Writers at that Web site, and at the temperamentally aligned Front Porch Republic, treasure tight communities and local bonds. They're alert to the ways capitalism can erode community. Dispositionally, they are more Walker Percy than Pat Robertson. TD Larison focuses on what he calls the imperial tendencies of both the Bush and Obama foreign policies. He crusades against what he sees as the unchecked killing power of drone strikes and champions a more modest and noninterventionist foreign policy. Lower-Middle Reformists. Reihan Salam, a writer for National Review, E21 and others, recently pointed out that there are two stories about where the Republican Party should go next. There is the upper-middle reform story: Republicans should soften their tone on the social issues to win over suburban voters along the coasts. Then there is a lower-middle reform story: Republicans should focus on the specific economic concerns of the multiethnic working class. Salam promotes the latter. This means acknowledging that working-class concerns are not what they were in the 1980s. The income tax is less burdensome than the payroll tax. Family disruption undermines social mobility. Republicans, he argues, should keep the social conservatism, which reinforces families, and supplement it with an agenda that supports upward mobility and social capital. Similarly, Henry Olsen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued for a Republican Party that listens more closely to working-class concerns. Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review has argued for family-friendly tax credits and other measures that reinforce middle-class dignity. Jim Manzi wrote a seminal article in National Affairs on the need to promote innovation while reducing inequality. Soft Libertarians. Some of the most influential bloggers on the right, like Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok and Megan McArdle, start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way. Many of these market-oriented writers emphasize that being pro-market is not the same as being pro-business. Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago published an influential book, ''A Capitalism for the People,'' that took aim at crony capitalism. Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner does muckraking reporting on corporate-federal collusion. Rising star Derek Khanna wrote a heralded paper on intellectual property rights for the House Republican Study Committee that was withdrawn by higher-ups in the party, presumably because it differed from the usual lobbyist-driven position. There are a number of unpredictable libertarian-leaning writers, including Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic on civil liberties issues, and Eugene Volokh on legal and free speech concerns. Burkean Revivalists. This group includes young conservatives whose intellectual roots go back to the organic vision of society described best by Edmund Burke but who are still deeply enmeshed in current policy debates. Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs is one of the two or three most influential young writers in politics today. He argues that we are now witnessing the fiscal crisis of the entitlement state, exemplified most of all by exploding health care costs. His magazine promotes a big agenda of institutional modernization. The lawyer Adam J. White has argued for an approach to jurisprudence and regulatory affairs based on modesty, but not a doctrinaire clinging to original intent. Ryan Streeter of Indiana champions civil-society conservatism, an updated version of the Jack Kemp style. By and large, these diverse writers did not grow up in the age of Reagan and are not trying to recapture it. They disdain what you might call Donor Base Republicanism. Most important, they matured intellectually within a far-reaching Web-based conversation. In contrast to many members of the conservative political-entertainment complex, they are data-driven, empirical and low-key in tone. They are united more by a style of feedback and mutual scrutiny than by a common agenda. Some politically unorthodox people in this conversation, such as Josh Barro of Bloomberg View, Meghan Clyne of National Affairs and Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute, specialize in puncturing sentimentality and groupthink. Since Nov. 6, the G.O.P. has experienced an epidemic of open-mindedness. The party may evolve quickly. If so, it'll be powerfully influenced by people with names like Reihan, Ramesh, Yuval and Derek Khanna.

33344,"A bill banning abortions in Albuquerque after 20 weeks of pregnancy will be on the Nov. 19 ballot. The City Council voted 5 to 4 late Monday to put the ''Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance'' to a vote. Abortion foes gathered enough petition signatures to require the council to either approve the law or put it to voters. Activists on both sides say it would be the first municipal ban on abortion. ''It is a new strategy,'' said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, which helped push the measure. ''There is more than one way to close an abortion clinic.''

33345,"WASHINGTON -- Senator Barack Obama informed two of his top three vice-presidential prospects Friday night that he would not be choosing them, Democratic officials said, encouraging a consensus within the party that he had settled on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. Mr. Obama's campaign and aides to Mr. Biden declined to comment. But Mr. Obama's notification to the two other candidates -- Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia -- was confirmed by senior associates of both men. TD The formal announcement was scheduled to be made in the form of text messages and e-mail messages sent to thousands of Obama supporters early Saturday. Mr. Obama and his running mate are scheduled to appear at an afternoon rally at the Old Statehouse in Springfield, Ill., the same place where Mr. Obama announced his candidacy for president 18 months ago. Mr. Obama's selection process has been so secretive that most people in his campaign headquarters still did not know what was going on Friday evening. Democrats were not ruling out the possibility that Mr. Obama could surprise the party with a choice other than Mr. Biden. Should Mr. Obama in fact chose Mr. Biden, he would be moving to plug what many Democrats see as a hole in his resume, turning to a six-term senator who is a leading authority on foreign policy. Mr. Biden's selection would amount to a critical strategic choice: to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about shortfalls in Mr. Obama's background, rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce Mr. Obama's message of change. Mr. Biden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and moves easily among foreign leaders and diplomats. Although he initially voted to authorize the war -- Mr. Obama has opposed the war from the start -- Mr. Biden has become a persistent critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq. Mr. Biden would complement Mr. Obama's antiwar position in the general election match-up against Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee, who has supported the war. Mr. Biden has a reputation for at times talking himself into trouble, and he was not always seen as a natural partner for Mr. Obama. A year ago, when he was himself running for the White House, Mr. Biden said Mr. Obama was ''not yet ready'' for the presidency. Some associates of Mr. Biden were informed by the Obama campaign to stand ready for television interviews on Saturday. Mr. Biden is Catholic, giving him appeal to that important voting bloc, though he favors abortion rights. He was born in Scranton, Pa., a swing state where he remains well known. Mr. Biden is up for re-election to the Senate this year, and he would presumably run for both positions simultaneously were he on the presidential ticket. Mr. Biden was elected to the Senate in 1972 when he was 29 and reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in. He served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee before taking over at Foreign Relations and has a long legislative record on issues such as law enforcement in addition to his work on international policy. Mr. Obama is announcing his choice as he moves into a critical stage of his campaign, preparing for the Democratic Party's four-day convention in Denver, which begins Monday. Mr. Obama's aides viewed the introduction of his vice-presidential choice as the beginning of a weeklong stretch in which Mr. Obama hopes to dominate the stage and position himself for the fall campaign. Mr. Biden is on what is by all accounts a relatively short list of possibilities. In addition to Mr. Bayh and Mr. Kaine, Mr. Obama also called Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut on Friday to inform him that he had chosen someone else, according to Democrats familiar with the race. As the selection process moved to an end, a Democrat who had once been viewed as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, whom Mr. Obama had defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- slipped out of contention. While the decision was being closely held inside the Obama campaign, aides across the country were told late Friday to begin informing local officials about the vice-presidential decision on Saturday morning. As the speculation grew, Mr. Obama spent the day in Chicago, practicing his convention speech and having dinner with his family. As he walked into a downtown restaurant, reporters yelled, ''Where's the text?'' He responded with a laugh, not saying a word as he walked inside. The pace of speculation quickened at the end of a day in which Mr. Obama's success at keeping his search secret -- with a combination of campaign discipline and political gamesmanship -- kept the world waiting and guessing. CNN showed a split screen of the homes of people considered to be top contenders as well as Midway Airport in Chicago, where the pick might presumably land at some point. News reports tracked the whereabouts of the families of Mr. Biden and Mr. Bayh with an intensity usually reserved for fleeing felons. After days devoted to reviewing the political pluses and minuses of the possibilities, news reports spiced things up by injecting a new name into the mix, Representative Chet Edwards of Texas, touching off a flurry of analyses. (Associates of Mr. Obama said he was never a serious contender for the nomination. ) On the Fox News Channel, the vice-presidential saga shared the stage with stories like the one about a North Carolina man who caught a record catfish with his granddaughter's Barbie fishing rod. But it was Mr. Obama who was really reeling them in, building the suspense over the choice in a strategic approach that left party operatives straining to decide whether it was a stroke of genius or a miscalculation. But a certain weariness of the vice-presidential game was emerging in some quarters, leaving other Democrats to wonder privately whether Mr. Obama's campaign was getting too cute in playing ''catch me if you can'' with the news media at the expense of a more resonant message on economic issues. Several Democratic strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern that Mr. Obama was losing an opportunity to make the most of the news of his running mate by announcing too closely to the nominating convention. That said, Mr. Obama clearly was not looking to his vice-presidential selection as a major moment in his presidential bid, and the relatively short roll-out, going into the convention, was designed to prevent the second wave of often negative re-examination news stories that follow selections like this. The anticipation of the text message promised by the Obama campaign and the hair-trigger posture of the press did leave some vulnerable to hoaxes. The apparent first big victim: The Wall Street Journal, which posted an urgent bulletin on Friday reporting that Mr. Obama had selected Mr. Kaine as his running mate. It immediately retracted the report, and the paper issued an apology: ''The Journal news department was sent an erroneous announcement about the selection of a vice presidential candidate for Barack Obama.

33346,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 -- The Energy Department said Monday that it was suspending its proposal to have the contractors who run nuclear weapons plants take charge of planning for how to ensure worker safety.   The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an oversight body created by Congress, had complained that the proposal could wipe out 50 years of rule making.   TD Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, said in a letter to the chairman of the board that the department would work with the board to redraft the rule and that ''any final rule will reflect my policy that safety standards will not be written by contractors.'' Mr. Abraham said the department would continue to seek a new rule that safety plans be reviewed by its headquarters, not field offices.

33347,"Most contributors to political campaigns are probably unaware that their money, under federal and state laws, can be used for all sorts of purposes. It can be channeled to other candidates, stored away for a future campaign or spent on unrelated expenses. A prominent New Jersey politician recently tried to use campaign funds to pay his defense lawyers. The state's election officials were right to turn him down.     Wayne R. Bryant, a former Democratic state senator, has been charged by federal prosecutors with using his position to get a no-show job at the state's medical college. Prosecutors say he showed his gratitude by directing millions of dollars in grants to the school. Mr. Bryant, a former chair of the appropriations committee, who apparently knows no shame, asked the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission for permission to pay his legal bills from his campaign coffers.     TD The request is unacceptable on its face. When people contribute to a candidate, they are being asked to support the democratic process. It is unlikely that they are expecting their dollars to help their preferred candidate fend off federal corruption charges.     Elected officials have to be able to raise money for legal defense funds. When they do, however, they should tell prospective contributors that their money will be used to pay lawyers' bills.     Mr. Bryant isn't the only politician willing to take such advantage of his contributors. At the federal level, former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, used campaign funds to help pay for his defense against bribery charges. More recently, Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, used campaign money to pay lawyers' fees related to his well-known encounter at an airport men's room.     Mr. Bryant argued that his criminal charges arose out of his work as an officeholder. But it is a very dim view of public service to say that contributors should expect that a candidate may naturally face criminal charges. New Jersey's commission, to its credit, refused to go along, but this should not be a gray area. Lawmakers in New Jersey and in Washington should expressly bar the use of campaign contributions to pay legal bills.     Until then, we would at least like to see some truth in advertising. If candidates want to preserve their options, they should be required to tell contributors that their money will go to one of two important causes: giving the people the best possible quality of government or, failing that, fighting to keep themselves out of jail.

33348,"WASHINGTON -- Government investigators said Friday that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state, stating unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Mrs. Clinton has said for months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house so she would not have to carry both a personal phone and a work phone. Her campaign said Friday that any government secrets found on the server had been classified after the fact. TD But the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies said the information they found was classified when it was sent and remains so now. Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and such information can be sent or stored only on computer networks with special safeguards. ''This classified information never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,'' Steve A. Linick, the State Department inspector general, said in a statement signed by him and I. Charles McCullough III, the inspector general for the intelligence community. The findings by the two inspectors general raise new questions about Mrs. Clinton's use of her personal email at the State Department, a practice that since March has been criticized by her Republican adversaries as well as advocates of open government, and has made some Democrats uneasy. Voters, however, do not appear swayed by the issue, according to polls. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said the classified information had originated with the nation's intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. It is against the law for someone to receive a classified document or briefing and then summarize that information in an unclassified email. The two investigators did not say whether Mrs. Clinton sent or received the emails. If she received them, it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified. The inspectors general did not address whether they believed Mrs. Clinton should have known such information was not appropriate for her personal email. Regardless, the disclosure is an example of an unforeseen consequence of Mrs. Clinton's unusual computer setup. Security experts have questioned whether her practice made government secrets more vulnerable to security risks and hacking. Exactly how much classified information Mrs. Clinton had on the server is unclear. Investigators said they searched a small sample of 40 emails and found four that contained government secrets. But Mr. McCullough said in a separate statement that although the State Department had granted limited access to its own inspector general, the department rejected Mr. McCullough's request for access to the 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton said were government-related and gave to the State Department. Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, is ''purported'' to also have copies of the 30,000 emails on a thumb drive, according to Mr. McCullough. Campaigning in New York on Friday, Mrs. Clinton pledged to cooperate with inquiries into her emails, but also said she would stay focused on the issues at the heart of her presidential campaign. ''We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But I'm also going to stay focused on the issues, particularly the big issues, that really matter to American families.'' The discovery of the four emails prompted Mr. McCullough to refer the matter to F.B.I. counterintelligence agents, who investigate crimes related to the mishandling of classified information. On Thursday night and again Friday morning, the Justice Department referred to the matter as a ''criminal referral,'' but later Friday dropped the word ''criminal.'' The inspectors general said late Friday that it was a ''security referral'' intended to alert authorities that ''classified information may exist on at least one private server and thumb drive that are not in the government's possession.'' Irrespective of the terminology, the referral raises the possibility of a Justice Department investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails as she campaigns for president. Polls show she is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by a wide margin. Mishandling classified information is a crime. Justice Department officials said no decision had been made about whether to open a criminal investigation. The refusal by the State Department to give Mr. McCullough access to the emails has reignited calls by Republicans for Mrs. Clinton to hand over the server that she used to house the personal email account. ''If Secretary Clinton truly has nothing to hide, she can prove it by immediately turning over her server to the proper authorities and allowing them to examine the complete record,'' Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on Friday. ''Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing.'' The Justice Department is typically reluctant to open politically charged investigations unless there is clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing. For example, authorities said last year that they would not open an investigation into dueling claims by the C.I.A. and the Senate Intelligence Committee in a dispute that also centered around access to classified information.

33349,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 -- Federal officials moved to step up security at financial centers and federal buildings in Washington and the New York City area on Monday in response to new intelligence about possible threats by Al Qaeda, even as some terrorism experts worried that the increased security might simply prompt terrorists to choose other targets.   ''You harden one target, you soften another,'' said John Gannon, the former deputy director for intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency who is staff director for the House Homeland Security Committee.   TD ''We've got our finger in the dike in the right places on this one, but we have to look for other holes that the terrorists might come through,'' said Mr. Gannon, who was briefed over the weekend on the increased terror threat.   Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security, plans to meet on Tuesday in Manhattan with Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, as well as chief executives from leading companies, and he will review new measures put in place to guard financial institutions, officials said.   On Sunday, Mr. Ridge raised the threat level to the second highest, orange, or ''high risk,'' for the financial sectors in New York City, northern New Jersey and Washington because of intelligence pointing to Qaeda reconnaissance missions aimed at the financial industry. Mr. Ridge listed five potential targets, including the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup buildings in Manhattan.   ''The secretary wants to see firsthand the new protective measures that have been put in place and offer employees a message of reassurance,'' said Brian Roehrkasse, the department's spokesman.   Domestic security officials continued working with local law enforcement agencies and private institutions in Washington and the New York area on Monday to bolster security in and around the financial institutions by increasing visitor inspections, camera surveillance, armed patrols, canine teams and other measures, officials said.   Even before the latest threat information, federal officials were using sophisticated air-monitoring devices at sites in Manhattan, Newark and Washington to help avert biological attacks. The air monitoring will continue, but there is no plan to expand the use of the devices, officials said.   At the same time, federal officials expanded security measures for possible targets beyond the financial sector. Some security personnel who guard federal buildings in New York City and Washington were told to expect increased workloads, officials said. And the Capitol Police said cars traveling through the Capitol complex -- including on Independence and Constitution Avenues -- would have to pass through a cordon of traffic barriers and police officers.   Chief Terrance W. Gainer of the United States Capitol Police said at a news conference on Monday that most vehicles would be allowed to pass slowly but that some could be pulled aside to be searched. One section of First Street on the Senate side of the Capitol will be closed north of Constitution to D Street.   Chief Gainer said 300 officers would be involved in the new security steps, which also include 14 vehicle checkpoints around the Capitol, and the costs could reach $3 million a month. Officials said the moves were long overdue but not directly related to Sunday's raised threat level.   A principal goal, officials said, is visibility.   ''It's important to send the message out to the public and to the terrorists that these are not soft targets,'' said one homeland security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''These are hardened targets, and that acts as a deterrent.''   Officials said they believe that increased visibility and public awareness could help to disrupt a terrorist plot or to discourage terrorists from carrying one out, as officials think happened when a suspected Qaeda operative believed to be studying the Brooklyn Bridge in 2003 reported that security was ''too hot.''   But with increased security at financial centers like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, there comes the risk that plotters could switch plans and pick a new target.   In the past, security and intelligence experts said, Al Qaeda has proved adept at shifting its targets in response to tightened security.   ''The problem is that they will take whatever time is necessary to get their operatives in place,'' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University at San Bernardino who studies terrorism and consults with the federal government on the issue.   ''Half this battle is psychological, and the mere show of force by the government at these locations will put people temporarily at ease,'' Professor Levin said. ''But in the long term, the difficulty you face is that people get complacent and things go back to business as usual, and that's what the terrorists want.''   Domestic security officials said they had no clear indication how long the code-orange alert would remain in place because the intelligence -- gathered from a recent arrest of a suspected Qaeda computer engineer in Pakistan -- did not indicate when a plot might be carried out.   ''We'll continue to assess the threats, and we'll see where it leads us,'' Mr. Roehrkasse said.

WASHINGTON -- The leaders around the nation's capital are pushing forward with plans to reopen the region, hoping they are close enough to their public health goals to move toward normalcy despite coronavirus infection rates that have alarmed federal officials. TD ''I want to make sure we all understand that moving into Phase 1 means that more people can get infected,'' Muriel E. Bowser, Washington's mayor, said on Wednesday as she announced that parts of the city would begin to reopen on Friday. ''It cannot be said enough: Every single one of us has a role to play.'' The northern suburbs of Virginia will also begin limited reopenings on Friday, while suburban counties in Maryland remain shuttered, underscoring the challenges that the region faces with boundaries that its residents crisscross daily. The Washington metropolitan area, home to 6.2 million people, is among the most interconnected regions in the nation, with a shared public transportation system and entwined economies. The region's unusual symbiosis is further complicated by the movements of congressional lawmakers in and out of town and a mercurial White House, all posing difficulties for the governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor of the District of Columbia -- a city that lacks the autonomy of states with the same or smaller populations -- as they move to bring their economies back to life. On Tuesday, in a private call with the nation's governors, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, singled out the Washington region as among a handful of metropolitan areas where positive coronavirus test rates remain above 10 percent. In the call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Birx also mentioned Baltimore and Richmond, the largest nearby cities. On Wednesday, Virginia reported 45 new deaths, the third day in a row of record increases. A majority of them were in the Washington suburbs, where the overall number of infections remains far higher than in the rest of the commonwealth. Nonetheless, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has said that because Northern Virginia health officials judged that the region had met four of the six metrics for reopening, the area would begin to do so on Friday, joining the less-affected parts of the commonwealth. That day, Virginia will also begin a statewide mask requirement for indoor businesses. The growth rates of new cases and deaths in the District of Columbia have mostly held steady at a time when rates have mostly fallen elsewhere in the country, underscoring the city's difficulty in fully reversing the course of the virus, as Dr. Birx would like to see. In Maryland, the two counties bordering Washington have opted to maintain stay-at-home orders as Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has moved to slowly open the state while leaving counties to decide their own path. On Wednesday, Marc Elrich, the county executive in Montgomery County, a sprawling and diverse suburb across the district line where the most Maryland deaths have occurred, said it would begin restricted reopenings in ''a matter of days.'' Another close-in suburb, Prince George's County -- which has nearly 30 percent of Maryland's cases even though it holds only 15 percent of the state's population -- is expected to take similar measures soon. A much-celebrated tranche of tests that Mr. Hogan procured from South Korea has not really made its way into the Maryland counties as many local leaders expected, and the counties closest to the nation's capital -- areas with the highest rates of infection and death -- have scrambled to obtain their own tests. ''Maryland's high positive infection rate, one of the highest in the country, shows just how limited our state's testing capacity is,'' said Representative Anthony G. Brown, a Democrat. ''We are not testing beyond our sickest residents, leaving us mostly blind to the broader community spread that is likely occurring.'' ''Local jurisdictions,'' he said, ''have been left to fend for themselves to get adequate testing and medical supplies in place. This is a threat to public health.'' Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan, noted that the governor had said that some components were still needed for the tests, which he got through a contact of his wife, to be used widely around the state. ''We have consistently directed much of the state's response to hardest-hit areas, with Montgomery and Prince George's receiving the most testing, the most hospitals,'' he said. In Washington, the racial disparities in death rates have been stark. For instance, Ward 4, a neighborhood with a mix of poor, middle-class and wealthy residents, has more infections -- 1,771 total -- than any other, largely attributed to workers in so-called essential jobs who take public transportation and often live in dense environments. But there have been only 63 deaths in that area. In Ward 8, one of the city's poorest areas, the 1,174 cases are in the middle of infection rates for the city's eight wards, but the number of deaths, 92, is the highest in the city. The difference, local health care experts said, most likely stems from the fact that Ward 4 is 47 percent black, while Ward 8 is 92 percent black. The city's black residents are more likely to be obese and have diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, all major risk factors for death with the coronavirus. ''I would add to the resource issue the black population's historically complex relationship with health care,'' said Yesim Sayin Taylor, the executive director of the D.C. Policy Center, a research organization. Ward 8 has far fewer health care resources than the rest of the city, and many residents may be getting tested for the coronavirus at a far later stage than other city residents. Poverty among black residents in Ward 8 may help explain why their death rates are higher than those of black residents in Prince George's County, where infection rates are high but deaths lag Montgomery County. Black residents make up about 62 percent of the Prince George's population, but income levels are higher. ''Wealth allows families to weather an unexpected emergency like Covid-19,'' said Danyelle Solomon, the vice president for race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. She noted that in Washington, black residents were 4.5 times more likely to experience poverty than their white counterparts, while in Maryland they were two times more likely. ''It has long been known that only 15 to 20 percent of good health is determined by medical care, and the other 80 percent is determined by the social determinants of health,'' said George A. Jones, the chief executive of Bread for the City, which provides food and services for poor residents of Washington. ''There is a phenomenon called 'weathering' that is used to describe African-Americans' poor health outcomes.'' Weathering ''is caused by the chronic stress of economic and social struggles, which accelerates the rate of health decline,'' he said. ''Racism in social and economic systems creates a chronic stress that causes worse health outcomes.''

33352,"Yes, the American military still uses bayonets, and quite a few. There are horses too. When Mitt Romney complained during Monday night's presidential debate that the Navy ""is smaller now than at any time since 1917,"" President Obama shot back with ""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.'' Mr. Obama's line, meant to underscore that military capability matters more than sheer numbers, quickly ignited a fire on the Internet. TD Marines quickly jumped in to say that they still attach bayonets to the end of their rifles, either the M4, M16 or M27. Of course, Mr. Obama did not say that the military has no bayonets and horses at all -- just that there were fewer now than then. While that is almost certainly true (the United States government drafted four million men in World War I), the 2012 United States Marine Corps still has more than 175,000 bayonets - or nearly one for each of the 197,500 current active-duty Marines. Marines carry bayonets when they deploy overseas, typically in sheaths attached to their body armor. In the martial arts training that all Marines receive, they are taught to attach them to their rifles in difficult or close-quarters situations. ""Basically when you're in a hand-to-hand-combat situation, if you're out of ammo and if your rifle malfunctions, you can attach the bayonet and still kill somebody,'' said Capt. Kendra Motz, a Marine Corps spokeswoman. The bayonet blade is 7 inches long. Horses are still used for funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and in formal military parades. One of their most well-known uses in recent years was in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, when elite teams of American commandos on horseback radioed in airstrikes to American pilots with the enemy's exact position. As for the Navy, Mr. Romney is right that it is the smallest since 1917, the year the United States entered World War I. The war buildup is easy to see in Navy statistics: In 1917 there were 342 ships in the Navy compared with 245 ships the year before. At the end of 2011, there were 285 ships in the Navy. That's a slight increase from the George W. Bush administration, when in 2007 there were 278 ships. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

33353,"Washington Tax Break Urged for Firms That Keep Health Benefits A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including the chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House and the Senate, asked the Internal Revenue Service on Monday to allow companies that continue paying the cost of health benefits for furloughed workers to remain eligible for a new tax credit. The tax credit essentially reimburses companies for up to half the wages they continue to pay workers who are furloughed amid the coronavirus pandemic. The credit, meant to encourage companies to keep paying workers amid virus-induced shutdowns, was part of an economic rescue package that passed Congress with bipartisan support. President Trump signed it in March. The lawmakers' concern stems from guidance that I.R.S. officials issued governing which companies are eligible for the credit, and to what degree. Companies qualify if they reduce employees' hours -- and thus, their pay -- amid the pandemic, but do not lay them off entirely. But it rules out benefits for companies that stop paying wages to their workers but continue to pay the cost of their health benefits. If a company ''is not paying wages to its employees for time that the employees are not providing services,'' the guidance states, ''it may not treat any portion of the health plan expenses as qualified wages.'' In a letter to the I.R.S., Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Finance Committee chairman, along with others, said that finding runs counter to the clear intent that members of Congress had expressed in crafting the law. ''We urge you to reconsider this determination,'' the lawmakers wrote, ''in light of congressional intent and the importance of providing access to affordable health care during the ongoing health crisis.'' Technology Britain Tests App On Isle of Wight The Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast, is renowned for a beautiful coastline and balmy climate, drawing crowds of summer tourists from across Britain. And it is now at the forefront of national attention for a different reason: The British government is preparing to begin a trial there this week of a mobile app that will track the contacts of people infected with the coronavirus. The app uses Bluetooth to ''alert people if they have been near somebody who is later diagnosed with having coronavirus,'' Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Sunday. The tracking system will be rolled out by the National Health Service, and if the trials are successful, it will be available this month throughout the country. Antibody Testing F.D.A. Presses for Data On Accuracy of Results The Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that companies selling coronavirus antibody tests must submit data proving accuracy within the next 10 days or face removal from the market. The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been infected with the coronavirus, but results have been widely varied. Since mid-March, the agency has permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing evidence that they are accurate. The F.D.A.'s action follows a report by more than 50 scientists, which found that only three out of 14 antibody tests gave consistently reliable results, and even the best had flaws. An evaluation by the National Institutes of Health, working with other federal health agencies, has also found ''a concerning number'' of commercial tests that are performing poorly, the F.D.A. said. The agency has also been under fire from Congress, with numerous lawmakers raising questions about the validity of some of the tests. While 12 companies have been given F.D.A. clearance to sell the antibody tests, many other products do not have agency authorization. The result has been a confusing landscape in which tests by established companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Cellex and most recently, Roche Diagnostics, are competing with unapproved tests made by unknown companies and sold by U.S. distributors with spotty track records. The F.D.A. has blocked imports of some antibody tests at the U.S. border, and has ordered some distributors to revise claims about what individuals can learn from them, or halt sales.

33354,"WASHINGTON -- Two days after Democratic senators blocked it, the Senate voted on Thursday to take up legislation that would grant the president negotiating freedom to complete an expansive trade accord with 11 nations on the Pacific Rim, setting off a contentious congressional debate on one of President Obama's top priorities for his remaining time in office. While the motion to consider the legislation passed 65-33, that belied how hard the coming weeks will be for the White House. Most Democrats, including the top three Democratic leaders in the Senate, voted against even opening debate to give Mr. Obama so-called trade promotion authority. TD And before the vote, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, suggested that she could not accept a bill that would keep the door open to negotiate trade deals for three years, and possibly six, well into the next administration. ''While three years in the trade promotion authority bill may be appropriate for foreseeable trade agreements, there is unease with a process that would provide carte blanche for agreements unknown, for countries to be determined, for a time in perpetuity,'' she said. The stakes in the larger trade agreement are substantial for American business interests, including Boeing, Nike, the pharmaceutical industry, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Most corporate interests are strongly pushing for the Pacific Rim accord. Labor groups say it would cost Americans jobs and erode wages. The Senate reversed itself on the matter two hours after senators broadly approved legislation that would crack down on countries that manipulate their currency rates, putting bipartisan pressure on House leaders to take up a measure that Mr. Obama argues could scuttle the delicate Pacific trade talks. The trade votes on Thursday were starkly different from the first effort to take up the issue on Tuesday. Then, Senate Democrats united against even considering trade promotion authority, to provide for ''fast track'' approval of trade deals, defying their own president and holding out for assurances that tough enforcement provisions would be attached to that authority. What they got instead was a compromise to allow the currency provision to come to a vote in a separate bill that now faces an even steeper climb than the fast-track bill. Even if a bipartisan majority can pressure Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio to allow a House vote on the currency measure, the White House has expressed opposition. A formal White House statement of policy on Thursday, however, stopped short of a veto threat. But by separating the currency bill from the decision to proceed, Senate leaders moved closer to granting the president the authority he seeks. ''Under our plan, the Senate will avoid the poison pills that had been floated in favor of the very type of bipartisan approach we've been advocating for all along,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, said. ''It allows senators to express themselves without endangering more American trade jobs for the people we represent.'' The vote on Thursday to take up trade promotion authority begins a difficult process of securing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade deal in more than two decades. It would put countries from Canada to Chile, Japan to Australia -- while excluding China, at least for now -- under an economic umbrella representing 40 percent of the world's economy. Obama administration officials say an accord cannot be reached until Congress assures the White House and the other nations involved that any trade deal cannot be amended by lawmakers, though it could be rejected. Next week, senators will try to put new demands on those final negotiations. Senators Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, and Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, still want American negotiators to be required to include a chapter in the trade pact forbidding the intentional deflation of a country's currency to make its exports cheaper and United States exports more expensive. Mr. Portman, a trade representative in the George W. Bush administration, acknowledged the opposition of Republican leaders and the White House. ''It's wrongheaded,'' he said. ''I think they should be embracing this to get more support.'' The Senate voted 78-20 on a broad trade enforcement bill that included a crackdown on countries that manipulate their currency. The currency provision would require the Commerce Department to investigate claims by American companies that competitor nations are manipulating their currency to promote their own industries. And if manipulation is found, the government would have to impose tariffs to raise the cost of imports to compensate for the currency price imbalance. But the White House insists that a more diplomatic approach should be pursued. ''Those provisions would undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic questions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer,'' a White House statement released on Thursday said. Even supporters said that vote was intended more to allow lawmakers to express their frustration on the currency issue. The real showdown will be over the Portman-Stabenow amendment attached to the trade promotion authority itself. If that reached Mr. Obama's desk, supporters say, the president would have to sign it. ''That currency bill is going nowhere,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. ''Portman's the real deal. That's firing with real bullets.'' The trade enforcement legislation includes the creation of an interagency trade enforcement center and a system to respond faster to unfair trade practices, like the dumping of exports at prices below the cost of production. Another provision would require the Customs and Border Protection agency to expeditiously investigate allegations of customs duty evasion. Still another would close a 75-year-old loophole that allows the importation of goods produced with child labor if a company cannot find those goods elsewhere. The Senate separately approved an extension of an African trade preference law, 97-1, intended to expand economic ties with that continent. The House speaker, who has long been at odds with Mr. Obama, looks as of he intends to be a bulwark for the White House on this issue. ''We've had this discussion about currency between countries and continents for the 25 years that I've been here, and to think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday. Democrats and Republicans in both congressional chambers disagree. Ms. Stabenow took to the Senate floor to argue that Japan's weak yen is effectively raising the price of American automobiles there. ''Currency manipulation is the most significant 21st-century trade barrier that American businesses and workers face today, and it is the least enforced against,'' she said. Ms. Pelosi expressed her own frustration with the White House. ''The administration has been pretty clear that they don't want this in the bill,'' she said. ''We keep saying, 'Well, what other suggestions do you have?' '' ''There is a general belief,'' she added, ''that currency manipulation has been responsible for the loss of many jobs in this country.'' Such talk has administration officials worried and playing defense. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said Japan has refrained in recent years from the kind of blatant currency manipulation it practiced in the past. And China, which has closely managed its own currency, has let the renminbi rise against the dollar. The Obama administration is walking a tightrope. Congress could give Mr. Obama the authority he needs to conclude a Pacific trade agreement that he sees as a central element to enhance the administration's strategic role in Asia. But officials say that the demands imposed by Congress could scare off key partners such as Japan and Malaysia just as the deal comes into reach.

33355,"CITY COUNCIL meetings in Austin, Tex., tend to be droning, low-drama affairs, but that wasn't the case earlier this month when barbecue was on the agenda: specifically, the smell of barbecue and a proposal to control it, in response to some citizen complaints. The suggestion that a smell some would dab behind their ears if possible should be mitigated by special exhaust systems called smoke-scrubbers provoked local outrage, with opponents accusing the complainers of being from California (in Texas, that's not a compliment). TD But that's the thing about smells. One person's putrid is another person's pleasant, and local governments around the country are having a hard time regulating what's in the olfaction of the beholder. If you time-traveled back 200 years or so, you'd likely scrunch up your nose. Our forebears threw sewage out their windows, and the primary mode of transport -- horses -- relieved themselves all over the street. And let's not even discuss the pervasive smell of rotting food in the prerefrigeration era. These days there is a product called Poo-Pourri (toilet odor inhibitor), and people place their dogs' business in knotted plastic bags. Moreover, food that is mildly bruised, wilted or minutes past its sell-by date is dispatched to a landfill long before it can produce the slightest offending odor. ''We have so reduced the level of background odor pollution, we are becoming more sensitive to anything we smell,'' said Pamela Dalton, an olfactory researcher at Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit group in Philadelphia that studies smell and taste. Just 20 years ago, you might not have noticed someone smoking in the same restaurant where you were dining, whereas today you'd likely detect the residual odor of cigarette smoke on the clothes of someone simply walking past your table. Over the years attempts by states and municipalities to regulate odor have led to a patchwork of legal guidelines subjectively enforced by inspectors who sniff the air and determine whether to make a stink about a stink. In the past the offenders were typically livestock operations and wastewater treatment plants, but more recently odor inspectors are getting calls about smells emanating from ethnic restaurants, coffee roasters and candle and bath shops. In an effort to be more objective, a growing number of locales have begun using a device called a Nasal Ranger, which looks like a megaphone for the nose and measures the intensity of smells according to a so-called dilution ratio. An odor is considered intrusive if the average person can smell it when it is diluted with seven parts clean air -- a decades-old threshold of stinky, the origin of which no one I spoke to can quite recall. ''Unless we're talking a rendering facility or asphalt plant, it's rare to find anything that exceeds a seven to one ratio,'' said Ben Siller, a licensed smell investigator with the Denver office of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. His city's odor ordinance also considers it a violation if his department receives more than five complaints from different households about a smell within a 12-hour period. And that has been happening more often lately because of marijuana growing operations, recently made legal in the state. ''It has a strong musky, skunky odor when they are drying and curing the leaves,'' Mr. Siller said. ''But even that only registers two to one on the Nasal Ranger,'' which he added is the same ratio registered when his neighborhood bakery bakes cinnamon rolls, and ''I never get a call about that.'' That's because whether we like or dislike a smell depends primarily on the context and associations we have with it. Unlike other senses, smell has a direct and immediate link to the limbic system, the part of the brain that produces emotions. Thus, smelling something triggers overwhelmingly strong feelings before we are even consciously aware we smelled something. As Rudyard Kipling said, ''Smells are surer than sights or sounds to make your heart-strings crack.'' Which brings us back to the complaints about the barbecue smell in Austin. Although you might love the smell of slow-smoked brisket because of its association with satiation and good times with family and friends, you can come to hate it if you are forced to smell it when and where you don't want or expect to. ''The smell becomes highly offensive because of the distress of being exposed against your free will,'' said Rachel Herz, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Brown University and author of ''The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell.'' ''It's similar to your neighbor blaring a song you once liked loudly and constantly.'' A spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection said that of the more than 10,000 odor complaints that came in last year, many were from residents upset about cooking smells wafting into their apartments from restaurants and coffeehouses -- smells that might be pleasing when patronizing those same establishments. ''A lot of it has to do with tolerance level in neighborhoods that are getting gentrified,'' said Mr. Siller in Denver. ''People at lower socioeconomic levels may tolerate something much better than someone who moves into the same area and buys a house, sinks a fortune into remodeling and then goes out in the backyard and smells a pot grower, charbroiler, pet food manufacturer or something stinky like that.'' If a smell is part of a plume that contains particulates or other irritants, then it can cause inflammatory- and allergic-type reactions. But researchers said, for the most part, it's the stress of smelling something you don't want to that makes people feel sick. Physiological symptoms might include headaches, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure. Psychologically, it tends to make people feel depressed, anxious and irritable. Case law on odor liability is mixed, with courts sometimes finding in favor of plaintiffs (sniffers) and other times defendants (emitters), as well as ruling for and against insurance companies, which typically claim odors are pollution and thus not covered under many policies. Recent cases in Manhattan pitting apartment building residents against odoriferous downstairs restaurants have ended in undisclosed monetary settlements and improved ventilation systems. But there are also cases that went to trial, like that of Maxine Furs in Birmingham, Ala., which failed to recoup $350,000 in cleaning costs after its inventory was infused with the smell of curry from a neighboring Indian food restaurant. ''The smell of Indian food makes me sick now,'' said John Pechi, owner of Maxine Furs. While there are technologies to control and deodorize odorous emissions, they are often prohibitively expensive, particularly for small businesses. That's why Austin's City Council decided to study further the proposal that would require barbecue joints to install them. At Franklin Barbecue in Austin, where on a recent Saturday lines started forming at 9:30 a.m., the owner, Aaron Franklin, said the solution is for businesses to be good neighbors. ''Our smokers are on the second floor so the smell dissipates before it drifts down, and we make sure our fires have a complete combustion so you don't get that gross-smelling creosote,'' he said. ''And we make sure kids in the neighborhood get food for their birthday parties'' so the positive emotional associations with the smell of his barbecue get imprinted early.

33356,"BOSTON -- More than a few eyebrows will likely be raised on Thursday when the Italian architect Renzo Piano unveils his design for the expansion of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here. The cultural watchdogs of Boston don't take well to change. And the museum, whose collections haven't moved since 1924, is one of the most beloved art institutions in this city. Its eclectic array of artworks from the Middle Ages to the early-20th century, displayed in a dazzling faux-Venetian palazzo, stands alongside those in the Frick Collection in Manhattan and the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif., as a rare -- and intimate -- expression of a single collector's vision. TD Well, the preservationists should put away their torches and pitchforks. Mr. Piano's design, dominated by a four-story copper-clad volume that encloses a 300-seat music hall and a temporary-exhibitions gallery, keeps a respectful distance from the Venetian dowager. And the new building's strong geometric forms should make a welcome counterpoint to the old one, which, from the outside at least, has always seemed a bit bland. If the design has a flaw, it's not that it tramples all over Gardner's memory, but that it holds it in too high regard. Mr. Piano has been so careful to protect the sanctity of the existing museum in his design that you may find yourself tiptoeing through the galleries instead of floating joyously through them as visitors do today. I doubt Isabella Gardner ever walked around on tiptoe; she was more the type to dance barefoot to Gypsy tunes. Born into a newly rich New York family in 1840, she moved north 20 years later and became known in Boston society as something of an eccentric outsider. After her 1 1/2-year-old son died of pneumonia, she seemed to find solace in the world of musicians, artists and writers; John Singer Sargent and Henry James became friends. She had two qualities that are crucial to building a great collection: an all-consuming curiosity and confidence in her own tastes. She was among the first Americans to collect Renaissance painting, and when men wealthier than Gardner -- like Pierpont Morgan and Henry Clay Frick -- pushed her out of the market, she turned her astute eye to Spanish and Chinese art, amassing formidable collections there too. The museum she built, which opened in 1903, reflects the same independence of mind. Its galleries are centered around a fabulously faux-Venetian courtyard overflowing with tropical and flowering plants, both a reflection of Gardner's catholic tastes and an image of feminine power. A Roman mosaic of Medusa's head dominates the garden. Rows of mismatched Venetian windows -- some real, others fake -- line its pink walls. The barely disguised references to the female realm pile up as you climb to the upper floors. A somber marble staircase is decorated with an ornate wrought-iron railing made from the frame of a bed from an Italian convent. In one upstairs gallery a small, pious painting of Jesus' head, lightly bearing the weight of the cross, is set on a small table just to one side of a wild abduction scene, Titian's ''Europa.'' Underneath is a framed fabric swatch from one of Gardner's ballroom gowns. As splendid and theatrical as the museum is, however, it has suffered over the years. Immediately after Gardner's death the main entry was shifted so that it now lines up with a vaulted side gallery, which meant that visitors lost the impact of stepping from the dark, brick entry corridor directly into the light-filled courtyard. A small bookstore and cafe were stuffed into the back of the first floor in the 1970s. Conservation offices and a temporary gallery are in a small 1930s addition plugged into the back of the museum, an area staff members refer to (not, it seems, with affection) as the doghouse. Meanwhile the number of visitors has grown from a few thousand a year to nearly 200,000. The addition will clear up some of that mess. The bookstore and cafe will be moved to addition's ground floor, and the space at the back of the old museum will eventually return to its original function as a meditative space with Buddhas and Chinese screens. The new music hall means that the second-floor Tapestry Room, which is often used for recitals, can now be returned to its original state. The collections will be freer to breathe. But Mr. Piano has done more, striking an ideal balance between new and old without compromising the identity of either. The addition, whose copper cladding will give it a muscular feel, is set discreetly behind the existing building. A narrow garden, 50 feet wide, separates the two, creating a palpable tension, as between two magnets held slightly apart. That sense of tension is also apparent in the addition, in a constant play between darkness and light, gravity and weightlessness. The ground-floor lobby and commercial spaces will be wrapped entirely in glass, with the copper-clad gallery, music hall and offices resting above. These three spaces will be divided by vertical bands of glass, so that from certain angles they will seem to be breaking apart. (The gorgeousness of these forms may very well be diminished by the treatment of the copper surface; Mr. Piano plans to treat the copper with acid, which will give it a uniformly green finish, rather than letting it age naturally, which would convey a passing of time.) The sense of discrete spaces is enhanced by the treatment of the individual interiors, which feel less uniform in character than those in some of Mr. Piano's earlier museums. The music hall, surrounded by narrow balconies, may be one of his most radical spaces in years. The extreme vertical organization and compactness of the room bring to mind La Fenice in Venice. Because the rigidly symmetrical hall is a square, 44 feet on each side, audience members will be staring directly at one other as well as down toward the stage, an effect that could be pleasingly voyeuristic or distracting; it's hard to tell. For the gallery space Mr. Piano has created a mechanical ceiling that moves up and down so curators can make the room airier or more intimate, depending on the needs of a given show. A high window, facing northeast toward the old building, can be blocked out with a system of computerized shades. Behind the addition Mr. Piano has also designed a giant greenhouse with a sloping glass wall. Conceived as an Arcadia for visiting artists and scholars, it will include a row of apartments and terraces running along the top like little treehouses. Some people, no doubt, will complain that this expansion is yet another example of museum bloat. But my only worry about the design has to do with the way it leads you to the old building's galleries. When the project is complete, sometime in 2011, visitors will no longer be able to approach through the old entry on the Fenway. Instead they will enter the complex through Mr. Piano's new lobby, and from there turn right and follow a glass-enclosed walkway through the garden and into the back of Gardner's palazzo. This significantly lengthens the distance between entry and artworks, which I suspect is intentional. In recent years more and more architects have used an extended architectural narrative to screen out the visual noise of the contemporary city, and in the process prepare visitors mentally for the act of viewing art. But it may also further reduce the impact of Gardner's original vision. The ability to move, in a few short steps, from the darkness of the brick vaulted lobby to the joyous explosion of light that fills the towering pink courtyard is not just a great architectural effect; it is a powerful metaphor for what art can do -- and what it did for her. Mr. Piano has given us a thoughtful, mature, even beautiful, building. And there is no question in my mind that it is necessary. Still, some of us will mourn the loss of that experience.

33357,"To the Editor: Your Aug. 27 editorial ''Dread of Flying'' proclaims the need to diminish congestion on the air side of travel. On the land side, though, we have a solution so obvious and immediate that we usually miss it: high-speed rail. TD For example, numbers gleaned from the Port Authority's ''2006 Airport Traffic Report'' for greater New York indicate that nearly 20 percent of domestic flights from the three major airports fly to the 17 most traveled airports within 350 miles. This significant share does not even include the numerous commuter flights to and from lesser, nearby centers, travel that requires nearly as much airspace as is used by the larger planes. Even at only 150 miles per hour, a 350-mile railroad journey would take less time from door to door than an airplane ride, with greatly reduced stress, delay and cancellation. And let's not forget the comparative carbon footprint. George B. Terrien Rockland, Me., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your aptly titled editorial ''Dread of Flying'' points out that airline passengers ''do expect the term 'estimated time of arrival' to mean something.'' I've always felt that the term should be changed to WNAB: will not arrive before. It's about the only certainty in air travel these days. Marcia Thompson East Falmouth, Mass., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Air-travel delays and the demise of airline efficiency are indeed a product of ''out-of-control congestion,'' but the underlying cause is out-of-control competition. While the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act has benefited consumers in some cases with lower ticket prices, the industry clearly needs a more advanced, specific and supportive regulatory system rather than strictly competitive markets to improve operations. Most industry players, including our current government, bristle at mention of the ''R'' word (regulation), but it is helpful to keep in mind what regulation really is: a concept borrowed from nature that ensures a living thing can function reliably, adapt and grow. The industry requires smart regulation -- including more deliberate coordination between the public and private sectors -- to facilitate efficiency and modernization. That is the truest consumer benefit. Matt Andersson Chicago, Aug. 27, 2007 The writer is president of Indigo Aerospace, an aviation advisory company. To the Editor: Your editorial hits the nail on the head by identifying the trend to fly more smaller aircraft where fewer large aircraft used to go. What is needed at our most congested airports are high-occupancy aircraft (H.O.A.) periods. These would be the most high-demand, overscheduled periods at an airport. An aircraft not having a capacity of, arguably, 175 seats would not be allowed to operate on a designated H.O.A. runway during an H.O.A. period. Aircraft not meeting the minimum capacity would pay a large fine, which would help finance the air-traffic-control system. We do it with commuter lanes on our expressways, so why not do it on our nation's runways? William Maloney Aurora, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: Your editorial says there is an urgent need to remedy the delays and overcrowding at airports, and that the government should cap the number of aircraft that airports can handle. In the context of concern about global warming, the solution is to drastically cut the amount of aircraft travel. Air transport accounts for about 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, but high-flying airplanes leave contrails that are believed to cause two to four times more global warming than carbon dioxide emissions normally generate. Curtailing air travel these days sounds like a hardship, but in the 1950s we lived comfortably with a small fraction of today's air travel. John Burton Washington, N.J., Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: It's not the lack of controlled airspace and the ability of the air-traffic-control system but the shortage of runways at our nation's major airports that is causing congestion and delays. The Federal Aviation Administration has the capacity to handle the number of commercial and private jets that crisscross the nation each day. It just doesn't have the concrete to put the jets on when they arrive or depart from most of our airports. Unfortunately, it's a situation that is not easily resolved because of insufficient real estate and environmental issues that arise when airport expansions are put on the table. It's a chicken-and-egg situation that must be solved to meet the growing needs of America's traveling public. Alfred S. Newman Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2007 To the Editor: While you accurately report a 24 percent increase in traffic in and out of Kennedy Airport since October, another statistic should be included: the 27 percent drop in the number of certified professional controllers at the airport. In 2004, Kennedy had 37 controllers; today there are 27. By the end of next summer there will be 21, all responsible for the predicted 1,500 aircraft landings and takeoffs a day. This staffing profile is found at almost every air-traffic-control facility in the United States as staffing continues to drop while volume increases, creating lower safety margins. While safety will always be a controller's No. 1 priority, we are being put into positions where chances for mistakes are greatly increased. The decreasing number of controllers will go on as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues its oppressive jailhouselike working conditions. Stephen J. Abraham Mamaroneck, N.Y., Aug. 28, 2007 The writer is a National Air Traffic Controllers Association representative at Kennedy Airport. DRAWING (DRAWING BY PETER HAMLIN) IN",[],ee
33358,"WASHINGTON, March 15 -- Senator John Kerry has conspicuously avoided speaking out on the terrorist attacks in Spain and the fall of the government there, a departure from his practice of trying to use the events of the day to bolster his case against President Bush.   All year, Mr. Kerry has argued that the war in Iraq has diverted resources and attention away from what should have been devoted to a more pernicious target, terrorist groups, and he has accused the president of squandering alliances that previous administrations carefully cultivated.   TD Yet in a 25-minute speech on Monday about terrorism and domestic security to the International Association of Firefighters, the senator mentioned the events in Spain only in passing. He accused the president of being ''short on action'' in protecting Americans against terrorism and added, ''As we saw again last week in Spain, real action is what we need.''   Democrats inside and outside Mr. Kerry's campaign said on Monday that the situation in Spain now was too uncertain and delicate to use politically.   The Kerry campaign said the senator had no plans to delve into Spain, even though he planned to make a big speech on national security on Wednesday.   One Democrat, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who dropped out of the presidential race last year, explained why Mr. Kerry might think it unwise to try to make political hay out of the tragedy.   ''First,'' Mr. Graham said, ''we don't know enough of what happened in Spain to develop a final conclusion.   ''Second, I don't think any American politician can run for president on a platform that they hope bad things happen to the people of America, and some might interpret an evaluation of the Spain tragedy on the campaign trail as a statement that we're next.''   Other Democratic politicians said American voters did not have to be told directly that the bombings in Spain showed that Mr. Bush had failed to stamp out terrorism.   For Mr. Kerry, said former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a friend and supporter of his onetime colleague and now president of New School University, ''there is an opportunity, but you've got to grieve the death, you've got to feel the tragedy, or there's no chance of getting public opinion on your side.''   At the White House, Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman, was asked repeatedly on Monday whether the administration thought the attacks in Spain had been intended to affect the outcome of the election there, whether the administration was concerned that the terrorists had prevailed and whether the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq would pose a problem.   Mr. McClellan dodged the questions. This was a typical answer: ''I think there's going to, obviously, be a lot of political analysis done on the election. Let me tell you what I know, and that is that terrorists are indiscriminate. They are indiscriminate in who they attack and when they attack. Terrorists have attacked civilians in Indonesia, they've attacked civilians in Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and a number of other places. Terrorists want to spread fear and chaos. They want to intimidate. That is why they attack innocent men, women and children. They have no regard for innocent life.''   But if the White House seemed defensive, Democratic politicians basically steered clear of the issue.   ''We're all sick to our stomachs that Al Qaeda seems to have scored a victory,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''After a real tragedy happens, you don't want to talk about it right away.''   Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Kerry early in the campaign before signing on with Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said, ''When an appropriate time has passed, I certainly think you can make what happened in Spain an issue.''   But now, Mr. Lehane continued, ''I think you just have to be very careful about not looking like you are trying to score political points when there are literally funerals going on.''   One of the few exceptions to the rule of silence was the response of Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who has few delegates but has not folded his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He issued a statement saying the events demonstrated that ''the invasion of Iraq has made us all less safe.''   Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said any linking of the terrorism in Spain with domestic politics would make politicians sound as if they were saying, ''I told you so.''   Leon E. Panetta, a former Democratic congressman from California who was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, said, ''The smart thing from my own experience is that when there's a highly charged emotional event in the world, you're better off letting that event play out by itself rather than engaging it politically.   ''Otherwise, you might pay a heavy price because you don't know how it's going to turn out.''

33359,"With the United States presidential election a top concern, investors are trying to make money in the stock market based on who might prevail in November. A liberal Democrat for president? Shares of stock in defense companies, or Papa John's pizza, might fall, some market researchers say. Another four years of President Trump? Consider buying Exxon. If Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Pete Buttigieg win the White House? Anybody's guess. TD The United States presidential election is still 10 months away. But players in the financial markets -- where tolerance for the unexpected tends to be low -- are already trading the politics of 2020 like a choose-your-own-mystery novel, with the ending unknown. Financial firms, keenly aware of the stark ideological differences between the top Democratic candidates and Mr. Trump, are creating ''candidate baskets,'' or bundles of investments tailored to several different outcomes in the general election. There is a ''progressive agenda'' group of stocks that analysts believe will fall if Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Bernie Sanders of Vermont wins the primary or the general election. Hedge funds are buying the equivalent of insurance policies that will pay them money if blue-chip stocks fall in the aftermath of a Warren or Sanders victory. On the flip side, some investors are buying oil exploration, defense and aerospace stocks, and banks that are expected to benefit if Mr. Trump prevails. And a stock-like instrument called the ''trade war'' fund, with exposure to companies that would be affected by the impact of new or changing tariffs, attracted substantial attention before being liquidated and converted into a private investment vehicle. ''Market participants agree that the U.S. election is the big event for 2020,'' Amelia Garnett, a salesperson in Goldman Sachs's securities division, said on a recent podcast. The financial industry views Ms. Warren in particular with apprehension, and her rise in the polls during the late summer and fall, Ms. Garnett added, inspired ''a rapid flurry of interest'' from clients to prepare for the possible impact of the type of higher-tax, bigger-government agenda Ms. Warren has promised. The goal for investors, of course, is to make money off their wagers -- or at least to avoid losing it due to some unforeseen political outcome. But some analysts say the performance of these politically oriented portfolios may also be a leading indicator of public opinion as the country braces for what's likely to be a volatile election year. ''The idea is this: we're going to end up either on the very left or the very right with this election,'' said Ben Emons, an investment strategist at Medley Global Advisors who has been fine-tuning the candidate baskets in recent months. ''The market will trade it,'' Mr. Emons added, ''because the market will price in the probabilities around these outcomes.'' Although the investment focus for progressive candidates has been on stocks to sell, analysts say there is also a reverse case involving stocks to buy. Those, according to Mr. Emons, could be in areas that Ms. Warren's policies, for example, would expand -- child-care providers like Bright Horizons Family Solutions, for instance, or green energy providers like Brookfield Renewable Partners. Although stocks to sell in a second term for President Trump have been less of an investor focus, Mr. Emons said that media stocks could fall under that category, given that news organizations are subject to frequent attacks from the president. Still, with the Iowa caucuses less than six weeks away, some market participants consider it far too early to place political bets now. Here is a look at analysis of various investments based on different election outcomes: The Trump Trade The economy has been solid this year, with unemployment at a 50-year low. As a result, the stock market has looked past potential red flags like wavering consumer confidence and manufacturing activity, and the S&P 500 had risen 29 percent as of late Thursday. Against that backdrop, many analysts believe that trading in anticipation of a second term for Mr. Trump has been simply a matter of continuing to buy shares of large companies that have fared well in recent years. ''Markets at this point kind of love gridlock in Washington,'' said Kevin Russell, the chief investment officer of UBS O'Connor, the Swiss bank's New York hedge-fund arm. Inaction in Congress, he said, means that the status quo will continue, with lower corporate tax rates and deregulation by executive order benefiting many large companies. To invest in that thesis, Mr. Russell typically encourages his clients to buy or sell specific sectors, rather than individual stocks. Mr. Emons believes that banks like JPMorgan Chase, which have benefited from Mr. Trump's pro-growth agenda and financial deregulation, are considered compelling ''Trump wins'' trades. The same goes for commodity companies like Exxon, which has benefited from his curbing of environmental protections, as well as major aerospace and defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Even the embattled Boeing -- whose chief executive was fired Monday amid a crisis over the safety of its 737 Max -- stands to benefit from Mr. Trump's policies, because of deregulation and the tariffs he has imposed on its European rival, Airbus. Mr. Emons calls Boeing a ''national champion'' for Mr. Trump. The Progressive Agenda Basket Positioning for a potential Democratic victory next November has been more complicated. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders -- whose platforms include plans for upending the current health care system, overhauling the financial system and fighting climate change -- have inspired a variety of market trades. The basic Warren or Sanders trade is a mirror image of the Trump trade: shorting, or betting against, blue-chip stocks. Several hedge-fund managers have already predicted a 25 or even 30 percent drop in the S&P if Ms. Warren were to win, for example, and the popularity of an option -- effectively an insurance policy -- on a drop in the index rose as she moved into the top tier of contenders, according to Ms. Garnett of Goldman Sachs and other strategists. To game out the potential impact of a Warren or Sanders victory, analysts at JPMorgan recently established a roster of 51 stocks. Called the Progressive Democratic Agenda Basket, it consists of companies that, for a variety of reasons, are expected to be most affected by the candidates should a progressive prevail.  Exxon, Chevron and other fossil fuel companies are on the list for negative impact, as are health-care providers like Cigna and Humana. So are banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, the private-equity firm Blackstone Group, and tech giants like Alphabet and Facebook, which Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have called for breaking up. Some of the less-obvious inclusions include the Gap and the pizza chain Papa John's International, which JPMorgan believes could face pressure on their profit margins if a progressive president pushes hikes in the national minimum wage. ''The biggest risk for 2020 is the presidential election, for which we recommend hedges,'' wrote Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a researcher in the bank's global cross-asset strategy group, and colleagues on Dec. 11. The second biggest concern, he said in an interview, is the chance of a recession. Of course, the stock market is a fickle animal, and any number of things could affect it in unexpected ways, proving the predictions wrong. The Unknowns Mr. Biden, the former vice president who has consistently led the polls among Democratic contenders, has so far stymied most of the stock-pickers. He has said he'll build upon the Affordable Care Act in order to retain a private insurance market for people who want to purchase health care on exchanges. Given that, Mr. Biden occupies a space between Mr. Trump -- who has tried to dismantle the health care law and revert to a system more dominated by private insurers -- and Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who envision a government-run single-payer system. Mr. Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who calls his middle-of-the-road approach to health care ''Medicare for All Who Want It'' and who, like Mr. Biden, has not yet fully articulated his proposed legislative agenda, is a similarly elusive investment target. ''I think the challenge with Biden and Buttigieg is that the platforms aren't really developed,'' said Mr. Russell of UBS O'Connor. Ultimately, stock investors crave nothing so much as greater certainty -- an element that may be in short supply for many months to come. ''We need to know who the Democratic candidate is,'' Ms. Garnett said, ''and the quicker we know that, the better it will be for the investing environment.''

33360,"Readers discuss the ethical and political arguments. ''Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us?'' one reader asks. To the Editor: TD Re ''Yes, He's Guilty. Impeachment Is a Mistake'' (column, Sept. 27): Like David Brooks, I thought an impeachment proceeding would be a mistake. As the process unfolds, I now realize that was all about calculation but not about our country's needs in this fraught moment in our history. Mr. Brooks says ''this will probably achieve nothing.'' If achieving nothing means removing the president from office, this is probably right. The impeachment process does, however, help Congress regain its rightful place as an equal branch of government meant to provide checks and balances on an out-of-control and corrupt executive branch. Now that's an achievement. Mr. Brooks writes that ''this process will increase public cynicism.'' What is more cynical than knowing that the president has recruited a foreign government to influence our election and doing nothing? ''This could embed Trumpism within the G.O.P.'' That ship has sailed. Who imagined a Republican Party blind to increasing debt before Mr. Trump? Since when do Republicans trample on the rights of states to set their own policies on protecting their air and water? As Nancy Pelosi said, ''He gave us no choice.'' The whistle-blower is a patriot. The Democrats' only choice was to have his back. Elliott Miller Bala Cynwyd, Pa. To the Editor: David Brooks advises that he spoke with ''hundreds of people'' in the last few days and ''only one even mentioned impeachment.'' I'm not sure whom Mr. Brooks is hanging out with, but they must be from another planet. James A. Steinberg Rhinebeck, N.Y. To the Editor: Impeach President Trump? That's just what he wants. Impeachment puts him in the narcissistic place that he wants to be: the center of attention. It draws attention away from his failures to make deals on important domestic and foreign policy issues like immigration, affordable health care, international trade and so on. The icing on the cake is that a partisan Republican Senate will not convict.  Donald Trump doesn't want to be impeached the same way that Br'er Rabbit didn't want to be thrown in the briar patch. Gary F. Marton Brooklyn To the Editor: Could it be the case that President Trump really does not understand that he did anything wrong in his conversation with the president of Ukraine? This may be just the way he's always done business, by threatening, bullying and demanding something of value in exchange for doing what he is already obligated to do. Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us? Lawrence Weisman Westport, Conn. To the Editor: In my fantasy board game ''Impeach Trump Now!'' I envision a deck of ''outrage'' cards from which players would draw. The cards would have various point values and would say things like ''Use of the presidency for personal enrichment,'' ''Chronic flagrant lying to the American public'' and ''Secret extortion of a foreign leader for political gain.''

33361,"If the election were held today, Joe Biden would crush President Trump. Almost any other Democrat -- including one named Generic Democrat -- would also beat the man who runs an administration of kooks, quacks, criminals, drunks, wife beaters and grifters. Sadly, there remains a sizable constituency for incompetency on this scale -- the look-the-other-way evangelicals, the get-yours-while-you-can corporate class, the ditch-your-principles Republican officeholders. They're with Stupid, no matter how much Trump debases the office. TD But you can't beat nothing with better-than-nothing. Not-Trump is not enough. Quick: What are Democrats for? Continuity With Change? Stronger Together? A Better Deal? Two of those are actual slogans of the national party, and one is from the feckless politician on ''Veep.'' Surprisingly, the Democrats are thinking big for once. The ideas being tossed around are risky enough to be called bold: a guaranteed-jobs program, universal health care, a public option for banking, free community college. But the best-known carriers of that message have problems. Nancy Pelosi is toxic in many a targeted red-to-blue district. Chuck Schumer sounds too much like a party hack. The presidential contenders all have weaknesses. If you were to go into a lab and create a perfect candidate for 2020, along with a popular policy prescription for this anxious decade, what would that look like? It would be a big-hearted, progressive person whose appeal crosses class lines. It would be someone very much like Biden -- a younger Biden. Let's ignore the age issue for now. Your candidate would need to be ethically clean -- no Wall Street speeches, no foundations that serve as backdoor ways to do well while doing good, no sexual misconduct. This is vital, because Trump has filled the swamp with odious creatures, taking their cues from him. People were sick of it in 2006 -- when Democrats won the House in part on campaigning against the ''culture of corruption.'' They were sick of it in 2016, when Hillary Clinton could not shake the stink of big finance-connected profiteering. And they are sick of it today, when more than half of Trump's cabinet has engaged in questionable behavior. It might help if your candidate was not from the political class. Oprah? She's not interested, so she says. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook showed some promise until we all realized that social media had been weaponized to destroy democracy. The entrepreneur Mark Cuban? Haven't we had enough of a reality show star playing at being president? This gets you to the bench of elected officials. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, is a whirlwind of Big Ideas of late. She just unveiled a financial first step for paycheck-to-paycheck Americans: a plan to require every post office to offer basic banking services -- an alternative to predatory payday loans. She is coldbloodedly #MeToo, having shoved her former colleague Al Franken and the Clintons under the bus. And she has gotten ahead of the one-note socialist Senator Bernie Sanders on the idea of a job guarantee for everyone who wants to work. The problem there is cost (up to a half-trillion dollars, by some estimates) and the bureaucratic nightmare it could create. Gillibrand is swinging for the fences, even if she did the least well of major Democrats against Trump in recent polling. Much of the party's energy is coming from the Sanders wing; Sanders himself will be 79 on Election Day 2020 and he is not getting any less cranky. But don't overlook the enthusiasm generated by the Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke or Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana. They've stood up for the basic right of health care, and against the wrong of more tax cuts for the rich -- foundational positions favored by a majority of the country. Another prospect is the Senate's resident vegan, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He's got some Wall Street problems and is less populist than the mood of the country. But he has terrific political skills; he wouldn't need a slogan like Stronger Together. In the same class is the rookie Senator Kamala Harris of California. She's sharp, dynamic, with the right balance of ego and intellect. But how would a California liberal play in Scranton, Pa.? That brings us back to Scranton-born Biden. A new study suggests that fear of cultural displacement was a greater driver for Trump voters than economic anxiety -- identity politics for aging white males. It would seem to take some of the working-class-savior reasoning out of Uncle Joe's candidacy. But that analysis still doesn't adequately explain the millions of people who voted for both Barack Obama and Trump. That's where Biden comes in, and why he cleans up against Trump in early matchups. The problem is that he will be 77 on Election Day. Trump will be 74. He's old and he's angry, and will get only older and angrier. Build a better Biden, from our political lab, and you win. But maybe the current Biden is built to last, with just enough septuagenarian strut to end the dark age of Trump.

33362,"They've become unrevealing quip contests. Nervous managers of the scheduled 2020 presidential debates are shuffling the logistics and locations to deal with the threat of the coronavirus. But here's a better idea: Scrap them altogether. And not for health reasons. TD The debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership. In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure, likability. It should also go without saying, dignity. Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily on the verdict than their true value deserves. Perhaps the most substantive televised debate of all was the first one, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, which Nixon was considered to have won on substance on the radio, while the cooler and more appealing Kennedy won on television. Since these weren't true debates, the concept of ''winning'' one of these odd encounters was always amorphous. (To be sure, many questions by panels of journalists were designed less to stimulate debate than to challenge one of the candidates.) Over time, the debates came to resemble professional wrestling matches, and more substantive debates were widely panned in the press. Points went to snappy comebacks and one-liners. Witty remarks drew laughs from the audience and got repeated for days and remembered for years. Some of them have been less than hilarious, but they did the job of dominating reaction to a debate. Whatever substance existed was largely ignored. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan debated the incumbent Jimmy Carter, Carter made a serious point about Reagan's position on Medicare, and Reagan's riposte, ''There you go again,'' a non-answer if ever there was one, brought down the house and that was that. In the first 1984 debate, Reagan, seeking re-election and at 73, the oldest person to be nominated for the presidency, seemed tired and tended to wander off mentally at times. His lackluster performance caused panic among his staff. Democratic supporters of former Vice President Walter Mondale saw an opening. But another debate soon followed. Thoroughly prepared, Reagan got off the crack, ''I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.'' The audience roared and Mr. Mondale feigned a laugh, knowing he was cooked. Not even Reagan's ending of that debate, reminiscing about driving along the Pacific Coast and musing about time capsules, was enough to undermine his political prospects. Reagan's ''joke'' aimed at nullifying the age issue dominated the post-debate chatter. But what is the point or relevance of the carefully prepared one-liner? It's as spontaneous as a can of sardines. It's usually delivered from a memory chip in the mind, having been fashioned and rehearsed with aides. When is a president called upon to put down an interlocutor, be it a member of Congress or a foreign leader? This, by the way, isn't written out of any concern that Donald Trump will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine in a long string of such contests. The point is that ''winning'' a debate, however assessed, should be irrelevant, as are the debates themselves. The better way to pay attention to and choose among the presidential candidates is to follow the long campaign that so many complain about. The reason for such moaning has always been a mystery, because unless the campaign is taking place in your living room, you can simply switch it off. The key words are ''pay attention to,'' because over the stretch of 2015-2016 it wasn't impossible to see the implications of a Trump presidency. Not just the vulgarity but the ignorance and insensitivity and extreme narcissism were apparent more than a year before Election Day. Moreover, we didn't need the debates to tell us that Trump had chosen to be the P.T. Barnum of American politics. For him, it was (and still is) all about the show, about distracting the public from reality. It was obvious that Mr. Trump had no real affinity for the working-class people whose votes he was chasing. Nothing in his life suggested that his heart was with struggling workers and farmers. It wasn't impossible to know that he wasn't the skilled businessman he professed to be. His bankruptcies and shady business practices and discrimination against Black tenants were no secret. The debates took us nowhere nearer the realities about arguably the most disastrous president in our history. They became simply another tool in his arsenal. The party conventions, also vestigial organs of a political system that no longer exists, are close to being done away with, if not for the reasons they should be. There's no reason not to throw the presidential debates on the trash heap of useless (at best) rituals that are no help in our making such a fateful decision.

33363,"Whether or not they liked the result of the presidential election, many publishers were pleased this week to see that the country remained as divided as ever.   Partisan wrangling, after all, sent liberals and conservatives to bookstores in droves over the last year, seeking out volumes that largely confirmed their views of the other side. From ''Unfit for Command,'' the antipathetic account of Senator John Kerry's service in Vietnam, to ''Against All Enemies,'' an insider's critical look at the Bush administration's buildup to war in Iraq, partisan political books led the best-seller lists for much of the year.   TD Books bashing Mr. Kerry are likely to disappear now, and those attacking President Bush might similarly fade away, at least for a while, as Democrats regroup. But publishing executives say they expect that books emphasizing the differences between Republicans and Democrats will remain popular for a long time.   ''Good or bad, the split in America right now creates a publishing opportunity on both sides of the fence,'' Jack Romanos, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster, said. ''To publish for the middle of the road right now would be suicide.''   In the short term, Democrats are likely to search for explanations of what went wrong in the election, and the probability is high that at least one or two Kerry campaign officials will offer an insider's view of the campaign. Bush administration officials who do not return for a second term could set off aggressive bidding wars for the right to publish their memoirs. The most coveted of those prizes would probably be Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who has not said whether he will depart.   Already, a book by George J. Tenet, former director of central intelligence, has been shopped around by Robert B. Barnett, the Washington lawyer who negotiated the publishing deal for former President Bill Clinton. Twelve publishers are expected to bid on the Tenet book beginning next week, and executives said Mr. Tenet could receive an advance of several million dollars for a book to be published in late 2005 or 2006.   In the longer term, Republicans are likely to try to promote some forward-looking books, as factions of the party vie for control of the agenda. Marji Ross, president and publisher of Regnery Publishing, is planning to put a big effort behind ''Winning the Future,'' by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, which will lay out ''a new Contract With America,'' Ms. Ross said. In January, Regnery will publish ''Men in Black'' by Mark Levin, an assessment of judicial activism and its effect on the courts.   Ms. Ross said that old-fashioned attack books would not disappear, however. ''Any book needs to have a sense of vitality and energy,'' she said. ''We don't want to be publishing boring policy books. We want people to feel their blood pressure rise when they read our books.''   Brad Miner, executive editor of American Compass, a conservative book club that is part of Bookspan, the company that includes the Book-of-the-Month Club, said he sent an e-mail message to several publishers on Wednesday recommending that they consider books that delve into ''moral issues.'' According to polls, a plurality of voters said Tuesday that those issues had the biggest effect on their choice for president.   Even with Mr. Bush having won a majority of the votes, however, conservatives are unlikely to think they are controlling the agenda, Mr. Miner said. ''Most conservatives still will feel that the momentum of the culture is against them,'' he said. That is likely to mean continued demand for authors like Ann Coulter and others who seem easily to engender outrage at perceptions of liberal excess.   Liberals, meanwhile, are likely to try to figure out what happened. Already, three books that seek to explain how conservatives have secured so much real estate on the electoral map have surged in sales.   ''What's the Matter With Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,'' by Thomas Frank, ranked as high as No. 2 on the Amazon.com best-seller list in the days after the election. The book, published in June by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company, takes a polemical look at what Mr. Frank calls the Great Backlash, the popular revolt against what conservatives see as a liberal establishment.   Also shooting up the best-seller lists was ''Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,'' by George Lakoff, a linguist who argues that Republicans have succeeded in part by controlling the language of the debate on social issues in a way that portrays their views most favorably. The book was published in mid-September by Chelsea Green Publishing.   And gaining renewed attention was ''The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,'' published in May by Penguin Press. The book, by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, United States-based journalists for The Economist magazine, analyzes the history and sociology of the conservative movement.   John Sterling, the president and publisher of Henry Holt, said the company made plans several weeks ago to have Mr. Frank of ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' available for interviews if the Democrats lost, a factor he cited for at least some of the book's renewed popularity. Mr. Sterling also made sure there were plenty of books on hand. After shipping more than 100,000 since publication in June, Mr. Sterling said he expected 15,000 more to go out the door in the week after the election.
